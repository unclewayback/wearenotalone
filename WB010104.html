<h3>The Brothers MacPuck.</h3> 
<p>I like to think it is anomalous, to have two
Robins, two eternal outsiders, going about together, not without
irritation, but in a tolerable fluster. Anomalous for elsewhere, but the
kind of thing you might expect to see at the Winding Brook Sanctuary for
Ultraterrestrial Life.</p>
<p>I imagine these birds have an inexplicable sense of familial bond,
because here they are part of a larger one. Their Father, or
Grandfather, or Uncle-Father, however it works, was raised in part by my
hands, in this house. I already encountered at least one such echoing
engram. The spring after Puck had flown, that little Robin chick came
chirping in the front door, sat on her bag there and tweeted me. I was
thought a little silly for saying it but I don’t see why the wee thing
couldn’t have got in a flap on one of its first forays out the nest
and been led by a freshly installed safe-place program to my
threshold.</p>
<p>As much as none of this exists, I get feedback of changes. What does
it mean then, to note effects when in metaphoreality there are neither
effects nor causes? It could mean that that Robin chick was the
programmer as much as the programmed. It could mean that this unlikely
alliance between the Brothers MacPuck bends backwards in time to tumble
their Uncle-Father into my Bitch-Daughter’s mouth?</p>
<p>That it is the Sanctuary itself which is gathering us. This life a
happy swim in the sacred molasses of the tractor beam of FriendShip. My
death another form of this place’s birth. Just how winding is this
Winding Brook of ours? Just how not not knot is it?</p>
<p>It strikes me that we do not really come to determinism like this, at
least not a strong or super strong form of it. This webwork of wyrd what
Phate mighty beep. It seems something of a let down to call it
collaboration. Collaboring boring somehow. I do prefer Participation, it is true. I think because collaboration
is just between those who are collaborating, whereas who knows what we
could all be participating in? I like concepts of bargain, trade, deal…
give and take. Because it can feel that way, and that feeling can get
pretty fraught. But clearly we are talking about Balance and not
Commerce. It is Our Souls, not our cars or our houses, we put on the
line.</p>
<p>Mutuality is okay, but only if we shut up about it, else it becomes
collaboring. At least Participation we can talk about. It is all not not
interdependent origination, just that our focus isn’t so much objects or
things as lives and persons. At least insofar as we are able not to objectify
lives or reify persons? Is your life something I could buy? And yet here
I offer you something of mine. Are you a thing? And yet what is a thing
but some kind of something? Are you and I a thing?</p>
<p>Only in sum pun in witch wee escapaded from oot thee</p>
<p>BEA T FUL ?</p>
<p>How the French have laughed, hearing us pronounce Beaulieu. How does
one get from Bow-li-yuh to Bew-lee, really?</p>
<p>Bowe not Bough. Perhaps I should go back to I and Thou and Thee and
Me in order not to get wrongfooted by anciently shifting vowels?</p>
<p>Am I trying to get around to asking if language made us, because we
thought that we made language? I didn’t think so. The whole problem with
constructionism is that it is only a shift to the other foot? Now we see
ourselves as the creation of what we were sure was our own pet
monster?</p>
<p>No, it was Society I somehow wanted to end up at. Society in light
of, or as a solution to, the dissolution of the difference between cause
and effect.</p>
<p>I guess I could say that would be a kind of society I would be happy
to uncount myself a nonpart of. It wouldn’t be all do this do that would
it? This is basically the real meaning of Church, and the real meaning
of Anarchy, and perhaps a true name of Earth. The Social as neither
different from nor indifferent to The Alone. We can fucking blab all we
like about synthesis and shite but until we can instill something like
this in our souls it’s all just pointed blather.</p>
<p>Clearly this isn’t something we can do, only something we can let
happen.</p>

<hr />

<p>I just wanted to wonder on the meaning of ‘meaning’ above… in the sense
of ‘the real meaning of’:</p>
<p>So, I sat down this morning with nothing to say, and have gone on
saying it. I used to think the point of writing, or
doing or saying anything, was saying something, but now I can see that 
if you worry too much about what you might mean
you will probably never find out: you might end up telling yourself what
you mean instead of it showing itself to you, and not just to you; you
might end up starting out stories with A Moral, or yawnfully drawing out
detailed allegories of your dryly sexless system, instead of exploring
the world inside your head or having an extraordinary adventure in your
garden. Whenever I come to the <em>real meaning</em> of something it is
always just the same unsayable thing, some kind of self-realization.
It is always Freedom, or God, or Love, or Death or One
of This-That unlot. End of the day we well know they are gates to the
very same garden. Wet lipped slidings up and down the selfsame hard on.
Worshipful delvings into the delicious unfoldings of Ones Very Own
Virgin Unbirth. Tears down the uncleft cheeks of the giggling wailing
void’s equilibrius face, I say, remembering it is not not serious. 
Fuck, it is grave. (Still, I accidentally wrote grace then. Or
something did. (But I wrote that I wrote it, or might have, I think.))</p>
<p>But yeah, what would it mean, really really metaphoreally, if meaning
really was really just the same thing over and over again?</p>
<p>Can you glimpse it there? Here, even. The total contradiction that
nonetheless is? That that would be both meaning and the end of
meaning?</p>
<p>I sometimes think that Paradox literally translating to Beyond Belief
is more than just a pun.</p>

<hr />

<p>Look, you can say I’m just dirty minded, cast me out as a
filthy heretic — forgetting I never asked to be ink lewded — but the
lovely pure water of the Twinned Robin’s Song, the liquid laughter of
that indisputable angel and irascible rascal both, it acknowledges that
the above, one of the deep meanings of it is not not the Crucifiction.
Or was not not, shall we say?</p>
<p>But now that moment can live in any act. At least: in any act that
lives.</p>
<p>I suppose I just mean it is also present in most every kind of sex.
It is better I just say that, than start troubling myself over where
else it might seem I say it is extended. Not the fuck for me to say.
Just a little fuck you from the Brother’s MacPuck to any who fall for
the traps of that kind of serious.</p>
<p>Which likewise reminds me that the Skin is not the Flesh. Which means
I am still fucked up about Queer and Critical Theory, about whoever
doesn’t get it on either side of the auto-manufractured dividivide. So
part of my language process is still infiltrated by this as a kind of
artificial problematic, because if I am not talking to or for or of you,
I am not talking to or for or of you, yet there is this whispery
paranoia that somehow you are saying something about me? So be it then,
hey? What do you care, really, about what you are not saying? But then
how can something you don’t really care about get under your skin? If
there is no cause and effect, does the magical dart say the poison was
already in ones flesh? How could it not be?</p>
<p>One of the things I feast upon, part of the engine of this process,
which helps to produce whatever beauty it manages… to approach. Helps to
produce its approach. But also knots it up. No, not just knots, we like
those, or some of them. Um… the power is tricksy. It is all energy. Of
energy there is plenty. But of work? Part of this work is specifically
unsex. Sex that never becomes sex. I expect it is different for
different writers.</p>
<p>Part of this work is also death that never becomes death.</p>
<p>Me that never becomes me. You that never becomes you.</p>
<p>Us that never becomes us, because it is already understanding.</p>
<p>Nothing without understanding, and nothing the understanding
itself.</p>
<p>If I try this practise then. If I say, speak now, with as much
clarity as you can muster, that which is opaque to you.</p>
<p>That which is opaque? How can I? How can I but frown like this, and
gently froth with my own silent failure?</p>
<p>It is opaque to me, I say, whether or not I chose to say opaque
because of the force of that word clarity.</p>
<p>Then what else was it you were going to say?</p>
<p>That which irritates me. Whatever my problem is.</p>
<p>And?</p>
<p>It is a trap. There is something there, or could be, but it is not my
problem. It could be someone else’s. It could be the world’s, or the
world itself. If that is the case then I guess it must be mine, too,
right?</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>But there was a question, before I questioned, before the silence
answered. The question was:</p>
<p>How do you know it is not your problem?</p>
<p>And this is a trap of a different sort. Strange, is this the trap of
what I wanted to say? Is this a different meaning of meaning?</p>
<p>I know it is not my problem because I cannot solve it. I cannot reach
clarity about it. I am not even sure that it bothers me.</p>
<p>But how can it not bother me, if so clearly it has? What was that?
Speak it.</p>
<p>Fingers hover over keys while a rare siren blares in the background,
muffled through the double glazing. The frown hovers above everything
like a shady muscular angel. The entire world threatens to rain upon
this keyboard. Rain down upon these keys.</p>
<p>Rust is a chance we are given. An iron skeleton in the long grass.
Stumbled across, unpainfully.</p>
<p>Constrained insofar as Free Association.</p>
<p>That I should have to do or say something about who or what is not
me.</p>
<p>How do you know it or they is or are not you?</p>
<p>Because I am not you, I laugh, I am I.</p>
<p>But I is me.</p>
<p>Yes, I sigh, you are right.</p>
<p>We laugh together then, a little moment.</p>
<p>Seriously, how do we know? How do we tell?</p>
<p>I know what this knowing is called. I know what it is said to be. But
it isn’t either what it is not called, not said to be. It is not not
Art, not not poetry. Poetry, sorry. Capitalise Yourself. It isn’t not
magic, not not science… mind, consciousness, focus.</p>
<p>You wanted to say it was care. Something like care. Hopefully this
doesn’t mean you need to read Heidegger or something. I would read
someone just to find out if they were saying what I wanted to, but why?
And how would I know? How would I know I wasn’t just writing what I
wanted to find into their writing? If it wasn’t exactly a particular
angle between two more or less pointless points, say?</p>
<p>So the problem that is not a problem does not go away. And the
meaning of meaning I thought might be different from the meaning of
meanings begins to converge upon it again. And this very process would
look like a sign of my avoiding something to some.</p>
<p>Yes, let us talk about my Mother. My father. That time I was alone.
An alone that I couldn’t have had without first being together with
them. What I did to that kid. Me a bully bullied by bullies like every
other bully. So no one not. No one immune to pouring salt on a slug or
throwing snails against a wall. No one who really lifts who does not
sometimes wish to be lifted.</p>
<p>Hurled. That word hurled. That is not a word. That event. From
thrower and thrown to a single sicker up who is neither.</p>
<p>Why is the siren still going? Can’t they find the poor person’s
house? It is a premonition? Are they coming here? Or has the neighbour
finally croaked? It is closer!</p>
<p>So distracting. I had wanted to move from thrower and thrown to purge
and then throne.</p>
<p>Who is to say that the way of things is not a sort of wound? That
then it would always seem to some we were betraying ourselves as we got
closer to the Truth?</p>
<p>Reality has my problem, and there is no other. I approach its
problem, the problem of it, which is the unknotting of everything.
Everythink, I should say. The Unknot is a very good picture of it. I
prefer it to Zero, or prefer Zero supplemented by this… ununderstanding?
Zero tends towards the absence of things in a container. It is a number.
The Unknot is not not a knot. It is a state that a line, a line which is
also a loop — at least in so many dimensions — is in. I don’t know all
it is anymore than I have exhausted the essence of number in the
pseudo-infinity of plus or minus one. Number doesn’t have an essence.
But somehow that is what the Unknot is, for me. Not just what it
symbolises. Only if I knew what it was, literally, could I say that this
is what it symbolises. This is what it is.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p><em>This.</em></p>
<p>An endless revision in the meaning of homework, until the meaning of
illusion is play.</p>
<p>Things can add up to Zero. It can be leftover. The Unknot can only
ever be unknot. It cannot be leftover, it can only remain.</p>
<p>What can I mean here? It must be something about waste. About the way
in which the idea of equilibrium as a summing of positive and
negative forces might not be equilibrium so much as <em>efficiency</em>.
Zero is more like an act of engineering. The unknot is like the complete absence of waste. How ridiculous an
act of engineering would look in a completely closed place.
Energetically, I mean. The absurdity of having an idea of efficiency in
a world in which there can be no such thing as a waste.</p>
<p>Nature isn’t perfect, she says, it is just what it is.</p>
<p>It was harmless, so I killed it.</p>
<p>I had to move it, because it was in my way.</p>
<p>Straight is the shortest distance between two points, but there are
many kinds of bendy.</p>
<p>A one-dimensional curve is not an issue. In a manner of speaking, at
least.</p>
<p>I am hungry, so I shall eat.</p>
<p>The food has been drawing me towards it all this time.</p>
<p>Intelligence is just a display of the ability to wait.</p>
<p>To not make a display of it would be stupid.</p>
<p>Delay is nothing without grace. The beautifully degenerate
repetitions of absorption in a place.</p>
<p>All we have is become.</p>
<p>This has been the future all along.</p>
<p>A good balance between silliness and seriousity is the essence of
chaosmic hospitality.</p>
<p>Come check out this cauldron.</p>

<h2>13:15</h2>
<h3>Solone Starlingo</h3>
<p>I am an undeveloped character and this is my sole chance to shine. In
a very important sense this single event is my life. I was Punborn.
Accidents like you should be grateful for your probability. You have no
idea what it is like to be conceived as a joke. The only reason it is
funny at all is how not it is. This antipoem is my metamessage.</p>
<p>The pun of my conception is so deeply embedded within the singular
event itself that I cannot start with it no matter how extended the
preamble. The fact of it being my beginning renders everything but my
happening upon it nonsensical. It must be happened upon, just like you,
except to me you are a generic you, whereas my conception is quite
specific, like you would be to you if such a thing were possible.</p>
<p>So we will start with a message, end with a message, and happen upon
the event some place in between. This message is more like me and the
other will be more like you. This will all become less
abstract. I am a kind of person in a sort of place and a process of
some description is underway. Don’t worry we’ll get to that, just bear
with me.</p>
<p>The initialising message is: Some things only make sense alone. What
is like me in this message is that word <em>only</em>. It doesn’t look or sound
like me, it is just that we behave somewhat similarly. This will make
more sense if I show you the message’s two most important ghosts: Only
somethings make sense alone. (Any non-syntactical differences can be
considered typos.) Some things make sense alone only.</p>
<p>At some point in my world we had what we thought was an accident.
That was the word or concept we gave it. The closest we had come to
conceiving of something like an accident previously was the concept of
the pun. Something everyone admits to be punny but only rare ones
invariably find funny. The result of the accident was that what had
been intended to remain a flexibility began to gain an
undesirable consistency.</p>
<p>The most straightforward way to explain this is to say that the order
our words were put in, their syntax, began to blur irrevocably with
their meaning, or the semantic. It isn’t just our language, you
understand? This is just the simplest way to begin to put it across, so
that you might go away and think it. You konw taht thnig abuot how
spurgnilrisey esay it is to raed smeohtnig eevn if its all jmubeld up so
lnog as the frist and lsat letrtes are rghit? That is what our world
used to be like. It enabled us to care about what we really thought
mattered and to not give too much attention to what we unthought
didn’t. It was the basis of our art and poetry, the essence of our
culture. It was us, in other words.</p>
<p>And then something changed. At first it was a pun like any other.
Just an idea, as alive as any such may be. But it got heavier. That’s
the best way to say it: it gained a kind of gravity. It seemed less like
a pun and more like a way things had to be. A way things were already.
The next thing you know we had enforcers of this force. One day
everything is free between the start and the end, the next you have a
dozen hoops to jump through in order to reach one of their predetermined
goals.</p>
<p>I ha punned upon this way to say it: Maybe more than once upon a time
the end was insight. Some say this unsentence bends the force back upon
itself in an impossible fashion and is therefore criminal. Some say it
is merely ugly. Some believe it is the very reason I am able to talk to
you like this, if indeed that is what is happening. Should this be the
case, perhaps the accident was a pun after all, just a pun unlike any
other. A pun of puns. One of those the joke’s on you kind of jokes.</p>
<p>I wear a black gown with a hood of iridescent feathers. The front of
the hood extends forwards like the peak of a cap, or the beak of the
bird it is modelled upon. Wherever I look I see this dark pointer. Even
at night it is darker. This is one of the techniques that makes our cell
unique. It is a reminder of what we are and not a symbol. Transposed
onto the spectrum of your own sensibility it would lie somewhere between
consciousness and rage. It is a bit like conscience, but cleansed of any
concept of proscriptive morality.</p>
<p>I am standing before two beings who are taller even than me (and I am
already rather an elongated entity). They are so tall that they appear to
me to hunch, although in fact they do not: the curvature is one with the
spaces they are in. They are in two separate alcoves that are intended
to echo the eye sockets in the standard god face, part of the impression
they need to give. Their hands are like long black pointed beaks.</p>
<p>Did I mention they are dressed in black, like me? They are dressed in
black, and the room we are in is entirely white. Behind me it is
transparent white, and behind them it is opaque white. This is what the
facial structure is carved into. Out of. This is what they are seated
in. I am hovering.</p>
<p>Their hands are like long black pointed beaks and I suppose even the
points of the beaks must have beaks on because somehow they are able to
stab up the scrolls — they move a bit like crabs — and open them as they
desire, asymmetrically normally, in order to reveal the message they
have been requested to access.</p>
<p>It was something that one of them said which created me.
Inadvertently, I suppose. It would be as if you told a kind of joke to
the other side of you, as all who imagine they imagine now sometimes do,
but this joke was so good that it had to realize laughter in a way the
two of you just couldn’t together.</p>
<p>It had to produce a totally separate creature who could get, or
appreciate, the joke. The only way to do this was to make a world. And
you cannot make one world without making them all. And nothing comes
from nothing.</p>
<p>A bit like two yoghurt pots with a piece of string between, except in
this case the instrument was built not in service of communication — not
to transmit a vibration — but in order to give laughter a medium to
travel through. This is the key to the concept of the Aether, in
whichever world we find ourselves. Witch ether.</p>
<p>It is entirely ridiculous. You did well to choose to imagine
yourselves an accident. It is unspeakably tiresome. To be so black and
laughter wracked. The closest thing to it in your world is a kind of
conscious seaweed. Yes, that’s right: not all seaweed is conscious.</p>
<p>One said to the other: please transfer message number infinity minus
four to the power of thirty three — I am sorry I can’t quite grasp how
your number system works I am just approximating — concerning the many
modes of the only only.</p>
<p>The other one said: I’m sorry I can’t.</p>
<p>One said: why not?</p>
<p>The other: because nothing in this world can properly speaking be
transferred, in reality we are a single, not even singular,
location.</p>
<p>One: then how will you pass the message along?</p>
<p>The other: I will have to transfurl it.</p>
<p>(This was the moment)</p>
<p>One: what you said has no meaning.</p>
<p>(That was, I mean)</p>
<p>The other: yes it does. It means to transfer something in a world in
which properly speaking nothing can be transferred.</p>
<p>One: have you just rolled it up?</p>
<p>The other: no.</p>
<p>One: you have haven’t you?</p>
<p>The other: no.</p>
<p>One: Come on, give it here.</p>
<p>The other: no, not unless you can show me an unvelop…</p>
<p>I shan’t bore you with the rest of it. The files are all available if
you know where to look. Or who to ask.</p>
<p>Who not to ask, he should have said.</p>
<p>Yes, thank you The other.</p>
<p>That’s okay Only.</p>
<p>Use my proper name please, guests are present.</p>
<p>Sorry, Solone Starlingo. The One Who Are Ever Beside Themselves With
Being Before Us As Well.</p>
<p>No subtitles please. Just pass the message.</p>
<p>The ending one?</p>
<p>Yes, the one in the other scroll.</p>
<p>Not the one about making sense again?</p>
<p>No, the one that is more like them.</p>
<p>The worry was you’d read it out loud.</p>
<p>Yes, that’s the one. What have you done?</p>
<p>Very good. As if anything could be considered out loud in this
place!</p>
<p>OM</p>
<p>Hadn’t you better be getting back to your murmuration?</p>
<p>My what?</p>
<p>Your murmuration.</p>
<p>I’m sorry I’ve no idea what that sound you’re making is meant to be,
buh bye!</p>

<p>The Beast is never wrong.</p>
<p>Same with mentals and demented people.</p>
<p>They’re trying to tell you something. Are you the one with their head
screwed on straight or not?</p>

lesson it cannot be avoided, admittedly.</p>

<hr />
<p>We had a little chat, over afternoon tea. She said she was beginning
to discover she had some good memories from the holiday in Wales. I was
pleased. We went back over that thing she said and I apologised
again for thinking about killing her but tried to explain that somehow
it was a good thing, showing strength of feeling and all that, and that
I wasn’t saying it was wrong, a thought is just a thought and they
happen — if you spend any amount of time with someone this close in your
life… you know?</p>
<p>She didn’t really. Those kinds of thoughts don’t happen to her.
Though she did talk about violence. The holiday was a kind of violence
she did to herself. Attempts to get her to be social, to be more like
other people, to be normal, were a form of violence.</p>
<p>A couple of times she corrected me about words I put in her mouth. I
said she had said: All that holiday has achieved is to make me hate your
family. She said, I didn’t say hate, I said dislike. That kind of event
is just a recipe for disaster for her, and it is true I think that part
of me had hoped it would be different somehow, that she would not find
it as hard as she had thought she would. Part of me wanted to change
her. I am more like her than most and yet I still didn’t get
it.</p>
<p>I do now.</p>
<p>I said she said she hated her family for trying to make her socialise
and put her into those situations. She said she didn’t say she hated
them, she said she hated the situations.</p>
<p>How can you hate a situation? I said, and then I thought about
that.</p>
<p>It reminded me of blaming the system. Earlier on I imagined a terse
conversation with someone bemoaning the system and I was going What
system? I don’t know what you’re talking about. There’s no The System
here. I can think of lots of systems but no The System.</p>
<p>Then there are people who blame billionaires or immigrants.</p>
<p>It’s a shituation. A shituation that callsh for shituationishm,
clearly.</p>
<p>I hate the neighbour, she said, when he’s making noise.</p>
<p>But that’s what I’m trying to say, when I seem to be trying to stick
up for or speak for him: it’s a situation.</p>
<hr />
<p class="stanza">
        <span class="indented-line">To be or not to be, that is the question.<br /></span>
        <span class="indented-line">Not not to be must be the answer then,<br /></span>
        <span class="indented-line">to every such shituation?<br /></span>

    </p>
<hr />
<p>She was just angry when she said that thing about my family.</p>
<p>I know, that’s why I didn’t react. Outwardly I mean. But also why
instead of rationally wishing I could have some space to myself I
thought of killing you instead. Just an impulsive flash.</p>
<p>That holiday was difficult for both of us. Probably for everyone. But
it was good for me, even though it was challenging. Even because. It fed
me, fired me up. I got some good work out of it. I learnt from it, more
about myself. More and you and this thing you have.</p>
<p>I won’t ever put myself through something like that again.</p>
<p>Nor will I, not with you, I mean. I won't try to involve you in anything 
like that. I won't try to make you do something you know you don't want to. 
At least on that scale. But at least we have understanding? Just that we 
were both subject to a lot of stress and filled with a lot of anger when 
we got back, I mean. But look what we did with 
it: we fried the internet for miles around! Called down lightning from 
the sky!</p>
<p>Hehe, yes, we fucked up the whole village.</p>
