    <p>The birds have almost started singing again, it seems. The full dawn
        chorus I mean, not just the liquid laughter of the Brothers MacPuck and
        the constant chatter of the sparrows. Chou said she heard a thrush this
        morning.</p>
    <p>The other day while working in the bathroom I thought I heard the
        blackbird. There was a background burble of distant starlings, perhaps
        the odd little tweeting here and there, the loud tootle of a wren. Then,
        without my really realizing it was happening, a great poet of the bird
        world came in and started whisperingly tying it all together, soft
        little resonant warbles of almost woken dream making the soundscape
        become a tapestry, become more than a random collection of feathered
        folk not particularly speaking to each other. A single tiny swell it
        was, in the soon to come orchestrals of spring.</p>
    <p>And then, almost at the same time as I began to notice what was
        happening, it stopped. I felt the blackbird somewhat embarrassed with
        himself, saying I’m sorry I don’t know what came over me, the concept of
        happiness is not meant to spontaneously reoccur for quite some time
        yet, please just forget I ever spoke.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>(Not tomorrow but the next day — nest day, I almoist wrote — that’ll be
        Brigid’s Day, Imbolc — the reason I mention it is because we’re
        nearly out of firewood. Don’t know whether to order a load, would be
        kind of nice to have survived this winter on our own supply, so might
        try to tough it out. Makes me think about one of the old stories
        concerning Brigid’s Day and weather divination: if the weather is fine,
        then winter still has some time left to run — the old hag has made the
        sun shine, you see, because she needs to go out and get more wood
        in.)</p>

    <h2>12:24</h2>

    <p>I wrote something in my notebook yesterday, about one clear way that
        Buddhism ‘beats’ Christianity: in being completely up front about
        respect for all life. I had to wonder what the point of even having a
        religion was, if it didn’t put that level of care up front?</p>
    <p>Today, just now, as I polished off yesterday’s Mackerel, saved from
        the supermarket dustbin, says Mister Cat, I thought: unless the entire
        point of Christianity is to concern itself exclusively with the death of
        the human. What does being kind to animals have to do with that? I know,
        everything has to do with everything, and yes, there is specifically
        that, but really? Focus!</p>
    <p>An exotic heretic, that’s what Chou called me this morning — said
        sounded good — as we were talking about something else. Religion crops
        up enough, it seems. (I love how things as apparently mundane as
        Portsmouth can sound a little exotic to me now. Stranger in a strange
        land. Normaldy, quite frankly.)</p>
    <p>Anyway, that is definitely one of the issues I’ve had with Christ,
        and Christianity: its focus on the human, explicitly in such a way as to
        demean non-human life, or to think its value only in relation to our own.
        (To separate ourselves from it in order to tell it what it is, basically.)</p>
    <p>Same problem I had with the idea of Anthropos, or the archetype of the human. A bit
        like with interdependent origination, or structuralism: it doesn’t mean
        anything in itself, only as part of a webwork of extra-human terms, or
        concepts, or ‘selves’. And those relations can become internal, in a
        more than dryly-philosophical fashion. Eternal, even. Your essence, your
        human essence, can buzz like an insect and squawk like a bird and mew
        like a cute baby mammal and hiss like a snake. Take a peek sometime!</p>
    <p>But also there is something honest about Anthropocentrism — or
        something akin to that concept — and I value honesty greatly. Even
        honesty which isn’t really honesty, like how nature will make a fly that
        looks like a wasp, but only enough to put you off, not enough to fool
        you if you’re really paying attention.</p>
    <p>So that is like a weird backdoor that Christianity has, if you really
        trip on it. A backdoor that is deep down strange inside it. God’s
        bumhole kind of strange. Strangel strange.</p>
    <p>(I once scrolled past a sign saying TEST IF YOU’RE AN ANGEL FOR FREE,
        but Mummy said no, the doctor guy looked kind of creepy.)</p>
    <p>The trick is that, in focusing exclusively on the human, it can
        humanize all life, if you are weird enough to feel that, or need it.
        Maybe brave enough to know it. So maybe it has to be YOU that does it,
        and not Christianity, per se.</p>
    <p>In Blake’s poem, The Divine Image, from Songs of Innocence, the image
        of God is not particularly this human form, some divine more-or-less
        generic human body, which nonetheless Blake is clearly very fond of — it
        is Love, Mercy, Pity, Peace.</p>
    <p>Ever wondered why Big Cats seem to have those tear drops designed
        into their very eyes?</p>
    <p>Wittgenstein said that if a Lion could speak we wouldn’t understand
        it. But then we have that word: Roar, and we understand that well
        enough. Isn’t that kind of a Lion’s word? Wouldn’t it be, even if we’d
        never seen a Lion not even on TV? I think so. I don’t think you can hear
        a Lion roar and not at least think you get the gist of it, nor be at
        least partly on the money. Who says that isn’t language? Who says this
        isn’t us being Lionized, at least a little bit, even as the Lion
        inevitably also gets Anthropomorphized?</p>
    <p>So Nature isn’t all Love Mercy Pity Peace, I agree. And nor are we.
        I’m not anyway. Whatever we choose to define us, or define ourselves by,
        which is what saying human means if it actually means anything more than
        what never needed to be said (which it doesn’t!) is never the whole of
        us, never all of it. How else could I be unlike myself some days?
        <em>Always.</em> How else could any organism catch a disease or develop a
        pathology?</p>
    <p>Can we then, really? Can they?</p>
    <p>Humanimalien Being. Or doing. Same thing.</p>
    <p>Because what is Love Mercy Pity Peace if it doesn’t apply to what
        it’s not? Doesn’t come into existence precisely through its own
        incompleteness? Even in some minuscule way. A way so tiny it undoes the
        concept of scale.</p>
    <p>It seems to come into being by relation, then, but how could the
        infinite ever be considered proportionate? The Real Infinite. Not the
        one that can be smaller inside some arbitrary subdivision of the one
        that can thus be greater, while the infinities themselves presumably go
        on equaling each other?</p>
    <p>Can they?</p>
    <p><em>How could we not?</em></p>

    <h2>15:16</h2>

    <p>Am just in the middle, or the middle of the start, of processing the
        lightning struck hawthorn. Just going at it with secateurs and saw, not
        quite no iron (sorry fairies) but no machine at least. Apart from me, naturally.</p>
    <p>Anyway, Chou, who had just finished working Dreki in the arena, calls
        me over, saying two Narcissi — the WBSUL name for our current reigning
        male pheasant — were fighting. I ran around the back of the house to
        join her in spectating. Huh, never seen that before, she said, more and
        more interesting things are starting to happen.</p>
    <p>There were two of the fellows chasing each other about, and then
        coming head to head, dipping down towards each other with their heads
        and then leaping a little way into the air with a flutter or two of
        their wings. One was slightly bigger than the other — fatter really —
        but in fact it was the skinnier fellow who seemed to be getting the
        better of it.</p>
    <p>On and on they went. The skinny one did look a little finer and
        prouder. Tidier, with a slightly more distinctive appearance, having a
        lighter, higher contrast wing.</p>
    <p>Shall we eat the loser? I asked.</p>
    <p>Nooo, she said, we will take him in and cuddle him.</p>
    <p>I laughed, he could be the totem bird of Fae Lurk: Narcissus the
        Loser Pheasant.</p>
    <p>Then I realized that would be the name of my pub: The Lazy
        Pheasant.</p>
    <p>It was quite a scene, with her riding mirror in the middle of them, our two
        Narcissi, and them fighting in front of it, just to the north of Clive,
        the oak who I was tripping up last year, in which event a Pheasant came
        into the tree and joined me, becoming the amusingly disturbing prize bird
        of my imagination; while just to the west I am in the process of chopping down,
        or up as the case may be, the hawthorn that was split in two by lightning
        a few weeks ago, a hawthorn who had already appeared in a kind of fiction
        I wrote a few years back, except as a blackthorn (as well as a ghostly lover or forgotten goddess)
        in a world that was a little like this one, excepting I had inverted all the
        directions, so this place’s north was that ones south, etc. Talk about
        echoes!</p>
    <p>I don’t know what we’ll do with the hawthorn yet but I’m happy to be
        processing it by hand. I kind of hoped I would but thought I would
        probably be too lazy. Luckily it so happens to be just that kind of a
        lazy sunday down here at the Lazy Pheasant!</p>
    <p>Chin chin!</p>
    <p>Good health all.</p>
    <p>(Just at the end of their battle the fat one appeared down at the
        bottom of the little alley of gorse we were stood at the top of, then
        the victor came through behind him and chased him right up towards us.
        He turned a few metres before he reached us and sulked off towards the
        far hedge. Don’t worry mate, I said, it was a good fight and we got a
        lot out of it!)</p>

<hr />

    <h2>17:13</h2>

    <p>A little shower comes over. Not quite finished with the thorn. Some
        thought about a jail or punishment room for people who failed to pass
        The Standard Joke test by laughing. Turns out that is The Standard Joke
        test, whereupon we see the person in the picture, sat alone at a desk in
        some forlorn corner, their face frozen in surprised boredom as if
        they’ve just looked up and seen us, with what they were looking at just
        moments before on the desk there: the very same picture. The Standard
        Joke test.</p>
    <p>And somehow reflecting back on that whole
        meaning-before-everything-thing, like a kind of anti-Kantian
        nothing-in-itself. The reason time flows in a certain direction, as well
        as the reason it doesn’t necessarily, on reflection, or a kind of
        reflection, being because of this… whatever it was.</p>
    <p>The idea is basically that if you looked at the results of Quantum
        Physics, say, through the lense of a search for meaning, that is: as if
        you were looking at an idea and not a kind of ‘reality’ or ‘the roots
        of matter’ or, say, ‘this world’ (in a knock on wood materialist sense)
        — then you would, or might, somehow find the results less surprising,
        and not necessarily in a bad way. This, somehow, gist-wise, is Qualom
        Aweganix, what Psychedelic Poetry really is and will be in or by the
        23rd Century. Like Wayback, or one ov um, said: information theory as a
        quest for meaning = confusion practice. Tis all gist-wise, purrhahahaps
        furevz.</p>
    <p>(The only other thing I wanted to note was that I would
        quite like to read that later Kant, the one that people seem a bit more suspicious
        about, as if he was senile or losing it — which he may well’ve been — I just
        think that even then it would be worthwhile to try to understand the
        kind of thing senile geniuses spend their time thinking they’re thinking
        about, or whatever.)</p>
    <hr />
    <p>O.Y. (Oh yeah, the Ungléshan way of translating post scriptus, or
        whatever P.S. means)</p>
    <p>Another thing I’ve found myself calling Mushi: Worzel Bunnage. He has
        this wonderfully disheveled look about him sometimes.</p>
