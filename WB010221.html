<h1>22nd February</h1>
<h2>07:30</h2>

<p>The first thing you should know is that Mushi the Bunny wasn’t always
his name. His previous companion had called him Bishi, meaning Bogey in
Chinese. The Knots didn’t feel right calling him that but they wanted a
word which sounded similar just in case he had gotten used to it. So
they called him Mushishi, or Mushi for short, although this would turn
out to be just one of his many names.</p>
<p>Mushi is a Japanese word meaning Insect, Mushishi was the title of
the main character in an anime the Knots were fond of, featuring an
itinerant shaman who wandered the Japanese countryside solving problems
caused by the people’s general ignorance regarding the invisible — at
least to some — creatures they lived their lives among. These little
nature spirits were the Mushi Mushishi was named for. A doctor of
visionary insects.</p>
<p>Mister Knot also found himself spontaneously calling him Monk. This
may have had something to do with the way he tucked himself into a neat
little ball, folding his front paws underneath him as if he were meditating and sitting like that
for long periods without moving, for all the
world like an ocean-smoothed stone. His fur was white and grey, mostly
white with little swathes and ripples of grey, his head half and half.
Madame Knot called him Little Cloud and this became his poetic
name.</p>
<p>One day Mister Knot was talking to a Wizard on the internet and he
mentioned Mushishi, thinking perhaps that because magicians liked
pulling rabbits out of hats they would be of interest to Wizards as
well. The Wizard was curious, for it wasn’t so long ago he had
encountered a random bunny rabbit hopping along the streets of London,
no doubt on the tail end of some adventure or other and on his way back
to his little girl’s bedroom.</p>
<p>Mister Knot told the Wizard that the rabbit’s poetic name was Little
Cloud and the Wizard said it sounded quite Chinese and showed him how it
would be written if it were — the Wizard was something of a sinologist,
you see — he said the name reminded him of another Cloud: Xu Yun, Empty
Cloud, a famous Zen Master of the modern period. Mister Knot was very
pleased by this as whenever a new animal arrived in his life he liked to
play the game of asking the question of what it might mean.</p>
<p>The Clouds seemed a sizable avenue.</p>
