<h1>January 19th, 2023</h1>
<h2>07:43 Winding Brook</h2>

<p>Dreamt of swimming in my Grandparent’s house. Curious reference to
one of my favourite half-remembered dreams from deep childhood: our
house flooded with water and me swimming, diving down into its rooms.
Here it was a little disappointing, only half-full and getting cold. I
think someone had left a door open.</p>
<p>Been dreaming, or coming close to remembering them, more than I have
in a while this week. Maybe just the way things go. Maybe related to
seeing family. Or Borderlands spirits. Or Glastonbury Goddess water
(drinking a little Chalice Well water every day, from the bottle we
filled). Or absence of local electromagnetic fields in the form of wi-fi
courtesy Lightning Strike. Ptchao!</p>

<p>Mary is acting like a Virgin again!<br />
Lovely pure clean water. I’ve missed it!<br />
Too tired to write, really, so will leave it at that.</p>
