<p>Wuz just finkin, after many doubts about blogging all my madness, and
sensible of courses of can always tone me down… would be cool if
names — like Puck, Little Odin — when they get mentioned
autolink to profiles. Same with places and a map. So wherever peeps come
in they can backtrack, or wander around a bit. The thing can be as
nonlinear as it is, basically. Could be really fun to craft a
hypertext.</p>
<p>To use some programming to auto-extract certain info/words, underline
them/link them, all that — as well as being able to make tag clouds or
conduct quantitative analysis and all the rest of it.</p>

<span class="indented-line">That every weary moment was timed by such a happy pendulum!</span></p>

<p>(I still have much to learn about doing a little something. I reach a
point but then I can lose myself for hours to no advance. I have enough
to be getting on with, trick is to use it. Do a little something. Do a
little something else.)</p>
<p>(I imagine reading a poem. The words begin to burble off, granulate
and buzz and pitch around. Reverberate. Once the poem has dissolved into
the chaos, and out of the chaos has come a tune, let’s sing it!)</p>
<p>(Things to hold onto in the aural marshes. A compass of qualities.
Like a phrase with a matching tone of voice. You can be True North
today. Tomorrow it will be wood, then fire. Another night something like
a gyroscopic laugh among the stars.)</p>
<p>(Set yourself a bar without not listening to what wants to come out.
You are still too aimless. But perhaps you’re just getting a feel for
the place, the potential. Wandering aboot. Still, couldn’t you even do
<em>that</em> a little more purposefully?)</p>
<p>(Sigh, yes Sam, I guess. What was that you were saying about taking
yourself seriously? Oh, I see, it doesn’t have to mean being serious.
Grim fool.)</p>

<hr />

<p>Not wearing my glasses. My eyes seem poor. Poorer than before.
Perhaps it is just the better spectacles. I should take some time
without them though. Nice to have a break from fookin lookin at shtuff,
te be haitch.</p>
<p>I’ll give them a rub in a minute, with the proper cloth. They got
wet. I was chopping down some Pussy Willow with me chainsaw, making
posts for Adam’s Field, which is where the horses will go when they’ve
finished the bottom of Happy Valley, in a day or three.</p>
<p>We leave for England, and thence for Way-alz, the day after tomorrow.
I will have much to do tomorrow. Finish that fencing, then test all the
electrics of it. Make the butterfly windchime for the evil one. I’m sure
there’s more. There’s certainly more, but those are the most
important.</p>
<p>I’ll give them a rub now, have a wee thinky.</p>
<p>Hope Mushi will be alright, all alone in the lounge and kitchen for a
week, without company or fire. Hope my nice rug will be alright too.</p>
<p>Agnes came today. She’ll be popping in twice a day so he won’t be
completely lonesome. I’m sure she won’t be able to resist stopping for a
quick strokey chat, young Mushleton. You’ll get your treats, and your —
yaawwwnn — saallaad. Not so keen on the green come Winter, are ya? Who
is mate, who is.</p>
<p>Mustn’t forget to pack me speedos.</p>
<p>Waterfall country.</p>
<p>(It’s gonna be fun! I already has injokes!)</p>
