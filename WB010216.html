<h1>16th February</h1>
<h2>06:59</h2>

<p>I think she’s a Wolf Spider, actually, the fellow in the bathroom, my
showering companion.</p>
<p>I didn’t attend the meeting last night — or yesterday evening, I mean
— as Chou experienced car trouble. First a battery problem at
Regneville, which she got help with, but then it broke down at Lessay
and the garage had to come collect her. It was their car that broke, as Jane is
waiting to have her sticky ignition fixed. Quite a fun little banger.
For some reason the little red AIR BAG light — I felt like it was
calling me a wind bag, so I kept saying: No <em>you’re</em> an air bag.
Anyway, we have another car now, but she didn’t arrive until just after
20:30, by which time the meeting was underway, so I will catch up with
Yann directly. Apparently he is on holiday next week so should have
time.</p>
<p>I was really exhausted, anyway. Bit of a silly time for a meeting I
thought but I suppose they want to give people time to have dinner and
such — the day doesn’t really end until 19:30 here, what with those 2
hours for lunch.</p>
<p>Why were you tired? asked Chou this morning, Did you do a lot
outside?</p>
<p>I answered rather crabbily that it is not currently that kind of
activity that is exhausting me. It is this. All this talking to you.
Brain stuff as some would see it, but to me a kind of metabolism on a
soulular level. Passing things back and forth all the time across
invisible — sorry, invisabubble — boundaries, so-called.</p>
<p>I thought back to that phrase Doctor Blake led me too: the awe-thrall
truth. It is true, I am in thrall. A kind of slave. It is very different
from enchantment or being enchanted, which is a holiday compared to
this.</p>
<p>I realize that I genuinely am not trying to convince anyone, even
myself, of anything, here. That’s not what all this talk of truth and
such is about. I still feel the energy of it is wrong somehow, something
somewhere is twisted or I have some lines crossed. I do need to relax,
let it be, let it circulate. The binds are not chains, necessarily. It
is somehow a necessary slavery. It concerns a way it is. So relax, don’t
fight it.</p>
<p>Perhaps I can’t ignore it, but I can’t do much about it either,
excepting trying to adjust my… figurations? Let me take a step back a
minute.</p>
<p>Things that come up like The Meaning of Realization. I know what that
is, on some level, but I haven’t expressed it, or perhaps
metaphorealized it, to my satisfaction.</p>
<p>You pick up a piece of string, tie a knot in it, glue the ends
together, and that is a model of a mathematical knot. The mathematical
knot is just a mathematical knot. Not really my subject either. I am
interested in its metaphorealization. Perhaps this is in the other
direction from the piece of string, but probably that’s too pat.</p>
<p>The thought that I should acknowledge that what I am doing, or
dealing with, is intuition. The feeling it is not somehow. That we’ll
get to that.</p>
<p>Something else.</p>
<p>The ‘shift’ or ‘change’, i.e. in fact simply an utter discontinuity,
between a simple loop, the unknot say, and a knot. To move between them
on their own plane, we have to cut. We cut the string, tie or untie the
knot, heal the ends back together. DNA is doing this kind of thing all
the time, apparently. Poor megacomplex tangle wrapped into a tiny space
and it has to keep on reconfiguring itself, so it has to be able to cut
and heal its own thread, the thread of itself.</p>
<p>But, also, we can take the knot up to the fourth dimension, perform
those operations, and then come back down. It is more on the level of
this, that I need to understand, than for instance the polynomials, the
mathematical equations that knots can be represented by. I may have to
grasp a little of them, in order to understand this, I suppose.</p>
<p>It may be I already have the picture I need, and well enough grasp
it, for it is rather straightforward in its way, albeit peculiarly
unsatisfying to me. If you spend some time with a Klein bottle you will
see it. But a Klein bottle already is a four dimensional structure: a
two dimensional surface in a four dimensional space; whereas a knot is a
one dimensional line in a three dimensional space. When we look at or
project a Klein bottle into three dimensional space it appears to
intersect itself. I guess, in 3d, it does. One way of showing how it
does not do this in 4d, is to consider it temporally, as if the fourth
dimension was time. Then, rather simply, the entirety of the object is
not present at the same time, our attention travels a section of it, and
thus at the time when it intersects itself in 3d, in 4d itself is not
there. Only one part of it is, say the going, but the coming will only
be there when it gets to the coming. Wrong analogy, because its all one
direction we travel in, but apt, for me personally, somehow.</p>
<p>It is <em>like</em> this. What I am ‘intuiting’.</p>
<p>But it is also like things it is not. It is like the Block Universe.
As if the Universe including time was a higher dimensional object or
sculpture. Imagine yourself as the cross section of a worm that is
everywhere you have been and everywhere you ever will be. Intuitively
easy and, to some, appealing. I don’t like this precisely because it is
close to what I feel, and yet precisely in that proximity, farther than
just saying banana or spilling a bucket of water on the floor.</p>
<p>One avenue is in the starts and ends of our threads. We could mark a
biological beginning point when our parent’s cells fused into our first
cell, or bunch of them, whatever it is. We could see tributaries of our
bio-stream branching off into our children before the great river of the
mass of us went out into the desert and evaporated. But, obviously
enough, this is a limited metaphor — analogy, really — based on an
understanding of ourselves as biological or genetic information. That’s
not it.</p>
<p>We can try the same thing with cause and effect on other planes. Not
it, not really.</p>
<p>Cultural inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>Nope. Doesn’t really matter what kind of information we’re modelling
or thinking in terms of. Not it.</p>
<p>But it is a bit like an object which has a complete state but at any
one moment — or place — is only partially present to itself. It is a bit
like that. A bit like time. A bit like a book, how it is all there but
cannot be read all at once and yet to read it all is an all at once in a
way, no matter how long it takes or how discontinuous the process may
seem.</p>
<p>But that’s not it. Closer to how it feels, or has felt, say… to
me.</p>
<p>I’ve missed something, skipped over something, said wait a minute to
some little person, and now I’m not sure where they’ve gone. Hello? Do
you want to say something before I try to carry on? Maybe they’ll jump
in, seems I need to get into the next bit…</p>
<p>That it is what I mean or intuit or begin to express in the concept
or idea of hyperdimensional touch. It is contact. A kind of.
Ultraterrestrial Encounter. Close, and very far at the same time.</p>
<p>It is a seeing blind. A special sacred kind of blindness which is
actually a way or form of seeing.</p>
<p>Honestly, I feel as if the Blind God, when we do not demonise Him, is
part of this. It is here, he really means.</p>
<p>The gnostics, some of them, talked about Him as an Abortion. A living
abortion. A kind of unintended consequence of Sophia’s daring (somewhat
heedless) plunge. That’s not quite the story I get. It’s not
exactly Earth, that I feel is the centre of this, anymore than I am.</p>
<p>I saw, became, the Great Universal Abortion, myself. Just as I have
been on the operating table of the Greys, that for me is an operative
plateau. And there I did something Christ also did, in a different way.
I blazed like Albion Rose, with the heat — and apparent pride, though it
is anything but, rather a total openness — of Lucifer. In stillness and
silence my hands became arthritic prayer and I was the Universe as an
Ancient Unborn Baby. Unbirthable. Start is linked to end.</p>
<p>What does it mean: If the doors of perception were cleansed, we would
see everything as it is: infinite?</p>
<p>What is <em>that</em> infinity? What is the infinity of any
particular — <em>particuliar</em> — ‘thing’ ?</p>
<p>You see, or feel, that this is a wound of me. For me. I feel very
conflicted about sharing it. I know that I cannot, really, share it. And
cannot not.</p>
<p>If you want to understand the character of Uncle Wayback, though, you
need to see this. At least see it in or through him. So it is necessary,
for this work.</p>
<p>I guess I shouldn’t be too sorry. It is not so different to the dying
god. To being grateful for or to something in and beyond that icon of
suffering who is the crucified christ. It is not really a pleasant gift.
It is and remains a wound, a perpetual wound. There is no beauty without
this sublime human-divine hurting. Every…</p>
<p>I don’t know, I’m thinking of those very feeling-full classical
musical movements, those wordless swells of bringing tears to our eyes,
how the immortal wounding underwrites them. But they are somehow too
clean or obvious, or simply classical, an example.</p>
<p>That is a rich and good conundrum, for me, a fertile place that
animates much of this quest of mine. The creation, or discovery in
myself, somewhat as myself… of a less classical example.</p>
<p>May every seat be throne.</p>

<hr />

<p>When I look to myself in this manner, to what I am living or what I
have to work with, you see the manner in which it is personal, yet
personal as a matter of necessity.</p>
<p>It is not me I come to like this, understand that. It is You, who I
shall for the moment talk about as Her — she is the one I am really
speaking to, here and inside me, however I am also aware that… not quite
that you simply overhear — I invite you, we invite you, give you the
opportunity to listen in, if you so wish.</p>
<p>Who I come to is the female presence I call Amulet. In a somewhat
literal way, the knots are like amulets, to me. They are something we
share, me and her, something we are looking at together, perhaps
contacting each other through, or else a way of us understanding what or
how that is.</p>
<p>It might just be me, a way of dealing with some of the excess energy
of it, or doing something in the meantime. Maybe it is just a
metaphorealization of the process of figuring out… looking in and
figuring out.</p>
<p>I honestly don’t know, and I am sorry if I give a false impression of
knowing. I have talked about what knowing is for me, though, and that is
feeling, essentially. It doesn’t help, for some reason, to call this
intuition. Perhaps it is not really what we think of as that, even
though it might be an aspect of what that really is.</p>
<p>Anyway, one way of thinking about Amulet, and understanding Wayback,
is to see her as the daughter he never had. You can perhaps empathise
with that, but you would be wrong if it made you feel at all sorry for
him.</p>
<p>It may be that she agreed to stay behind — beyond — in order to do
this work with him. Tether, apart from being related both to the concept
of physical and metaphysical and likely also magical Aether, and apart
from its relation to the Akashic Field, thus Records… it is exemplified
most purely in relations such as this: the connection between Uncle
Wayback and Amulet.</p>
<p>Maybe she is simply a crazy person like him, in the future or in a
parallel world, and this is how they bond. She may also not be human.
There is another way I see her sometimes that would seem to suggest not.
This is on one level a quite simple geometry of two circles within a
more squashed or ovaling third (or first, but to be honest if such
orderings exist they are meaningful and not temporal relationships). On
another level it is two hands, that move from something like fists to
something like a fan of open hands. On another level it is a kind of
cute Grey alien, more like E.T. though. I have seen her as a wreath in a
tree… I might just be confused.</p>
<p>You understand, however, that there is a specificity to or within
this confusion. Likely this is part of the constellation
<em>particuliarity</em>.</p>
<p>One important point I must make is that it would be wrong — I think
so, of course you are free to think otherwise or otherwise disagree — to
reduce this to a kind of trauma. A traumatic absence in my life. My
having failed some deep part of myself by not having produced a child or
children. I do explore and have explored these aspects to my own
satisfaction. Certainly they are part of it. But these are parts of how
it works, for me. It is these powerful psycho-physical binds that are
part of what fix me to what, with due attention and energy, then becomes
a revelation or realization of a higher order. Trauma is a gateway or
portal. It doesn’t reduce to that excepting the way in which something
like a painting or a picture can be said to act as or be a portal.
Similar to the way we might understand poetry as meaningfully
inexhaustible — only it would have to be something integral to the
poetry and not merely given to it by the shifting circumstances of
context including both individual perspectives and the nature of time.
In other words the meaning is inexhaustible NOT because every individual
has their own approach and set of interpretations AND NOT because the
world is always moving or changing in time. The picture is a picture of
infinity. It is a knot. And not the trivial one we employ as a symbol
for it! (Though it could be for God.)</p>
<p>I feel very alone in this. Maybe that is part of the trauma that
produces the agitation necessary for these parts or aspects of my diary
or log. But I don’t know. Amulet is part of this aloneness, not really a
relief of or from it. Nothing is. Apart from it, somehow.</p>
<p>It is quite possible, I do hereby seriously entertain the
possibility, that not many people are or ever will be capable of seeing
this in a way that they actually realize they are. Seeing blind, so to
speak, or else engaging ones potential for hyperdimensional touch. That
is Portal Tech, I guess. I tend to accidentally write poetential in such
cases!</p>
<p>This does make me a kind of Genius. It is also traumatic and
difficult for me to admit or confront this. Particularly because I am a
dumb Genius. Hence the term, perhaps slightly offensive to some, Wiztard. I
can’t do anything with or about this, short of what I’m doing. I am the
fool, and not always the funny one. One of the names for the Demiurge,
the great demon, is Saklas: Blind One, Fool. This is not not me. I am
not not The Black Fool. I am insanity, and my only medicine is madness.
That’s why I’m sorry.</p>
<p>I am kept company here by uncomfortable things.</p>
<p>You can understand that.</p>
<p>It is awkward and uncomfortable things that keep this part of me
comfortable.</p>
<p>Part of me.</p>
<p>You see, I know it is not me, not all of me, when I look into me or
get personal, I come to Amulet, I come to this strange little girl.</p>
<p>But I am also a furious, raging, potentially murderous male.</p>
<p>I am a kind old man.</p>
<p>But she is the core or heart of it, somehow. You see that being kept
company by difficult things is no different from the way in which I
embrace the cute. This is how I understand the cute.</p>
<p>There are four of me. I am working with that assumption at the
moment. Not simply Blake’s Four Great Ones in Every Man. Human, you
understand. No, there are four of <em>me</em>. We are the same person in
different modes or places or realities. We are totally the same person.
And this is exactly the reason we have turned out different. One of us
is funnier. One is more balanced (or equaninimous? ninny moose?) One is
more extreme. One is moody, brooding. We have done it to each other
somehow. We are each all of us, and one. I’m not sure which one this is.
I don’t think it works like that. We’re all all of us and not. One
simple model would be to seperate our characters from our persons, and
rotate the characters. Yet somehow all our persons are really fixed on a
single central point.</p>
<p>Yes, it is everywhere and nowhere. It is given, and something we come
to learn, something we have to bring ourselves to.</p>
<p>There are ways in which a kind of total relativity and a relational
consistency coexist in all moments. Total relativity is more like the
possible and relational consistency is closer to potential, they are
both illusions created by what is and what is is an illusion created by
them.</p>
<p>Harrumph.</p>
<p>Ah yes, this was just a way of saying why or how certain creatures
embody it — definite scarequotes there — more than others, for me.</p>
<p>Which is to say it was The Hare who was the first creature ever to
keep me company here, in this way. Somehow The Hare is <em>it</em> more
than anyone else for me. Little Odin, you in particuliar.</p>
<p>He is the messenger, or carrier — my mercury or hermes — our go
between. He is the link between Amulet and I. It is for him, to give to
her, that I make the semi-private metafictional language that is
Confusion Practise or Not Knot Theory. In some way that’s what he is. In
another way, Lôrien is more like her, more like her Hare. Lôrien
unlocked the Ultraterrestrial moment.</p>
<p>When I look at, when I encounter, a hare, I see and feel all this.
The Hare is the metaphorealization of it par excellence. Only it is not
simply or only the biological individual, nor some kind of ideal eternal
entity. A particuliar character in a particuliar kind of story.</p>
<p>I jump, jump back to knowing I have no issue with that kind of
abstraction: the categorical. I appreciate such schemas for what they
are, both the metaphoreal and the metaphorical open on to and make use
of them. It is not so far off to think about metaphor as a going between
abstraction and concretion like this, and sure there is something meaty
in how we could see the discrete — discretion — as the hidden partner in
this. The concrete is the continuous, the abstract is a kind of stand in
for the impossibly discrete.</p>
<p>There is a very particuliar sense in which I have a distaste for
abstraction, which is better off just understood as a solid example of
the difference between quality and quantity, discretion or gnosis for us
can be primarily referred to this simple case, and its inexhaustible
applications. Discernment.</p>
<p>Firstly, of course we have issues with authority, and issues wherever
some kind of imposition occurs, and this includes the truth itself. We
are Loki-like in this fashion, it is he who gets brought to mind here:
both the maker of the net and a fishy flapping about in it. Don’t get
too distracted!</p>
<p>It all unfolds in a single movement, is the problem AND the
answer.</p>
<p>So yes, there is the standard critique of the general as some kind of
box-ticking exercise or an ever ill-fitting ‘thing’. Bureaucracy. So we
look to Psychedelic Analogic to understand more flexible, provisional,
dynamic and productive uses of such schemas. The same kind of schema,
treated in a slightly different way. A bit like reifying nothing. There
is this extra place or touch of excess by which the schemes themselves
pass through themselves — you get a holographic picture in which each
contains all. I am wandering!</p>
<p>The example is this: the discontinuity between a knot and a not knot
or the unknot. You can transform one into the other by cutting,
operating, and healing; or you can abduct the creature, change it, and
put it back. Maybe this is even what abduction as opposed to induction
or deduction really means! Crazy, wild, stupid. But there’s a hint
there, of a certain kind of sense, that roots in or grows out of an
impossible experience, which is the only way to really understand what
I’m on about, which is impossible to enjoy, but more on that later,
because it is also an aspect of our ebullience.</p>
<p>So, you reckon you can do it by going up and then coming back down a
dimension. What is this dimension? Teach me what this dimension is. Use
me to teach yourself something: find out the precise manner in which I
am wrong, because that is what I am trying to show you. Like a paradox
would.</p>
<p>Because the knots are knot simply or only or really mathematical
knots, for me. They are more like fairy knots. Tied in the manes of
impossible horses.</p>
<p>The difference between a knot and a not knot is what I really mean by
dimension. The singular qualitative dimension. The key to understanding,
if nothing else. The one thought you can almost think that is like a
continual stream of revelation. Realization, your highness.</p>
<p>First dimension, a point for convenience. A direction if you want to
feel it a bit more concretely.</p>
<p>Second, the plane. Inconvenient now, that direction. Still the same
direction, only broader. This dimension can be seen entirely as a
multiplication of those points, or a field felt between them. Perhaps
the same direction but now as a cord or clustering of wires or lines:
turn or twist them if you like — the first dimension could curve — but
you can’t really think of turning them back on themselves… can you? You
can’t properly conceive within them the movement which would lead to
their closure? (Except it has been there all along.)</p>
<p>Third. I should have kept it simple. I’m confused. I’m stuck in the
single dimension which is the choice of which way you want to see the
thread, which way you travel the knot, which in itself makes no
difference. Curious though, that only here in three space could I allow
it to return to its origin, when theoretically it could have done it in
two, in one, happened already. Obviously there are no knots on the flat,
because there crossings are intersections — there is no over and under
for them to pass.</p>
<p>The solid decomposes into planes and the planes decompose into points
this is all you need to see to understand that you are only thinking
quantitively. Degrees of freedom is just a phrase. You think language is
arbitrary because there are many of them, but language has meanings
which phrases such as degrees of freedom do not. It just refers to a
very technical possibility within a very limited world, it doesn’t mean
anything. It is you who are being arbitrary, and now me who seems mean,
to me. But I am only stating…</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I don’t know. I am not sure it comes from certain axioms, if that is
what I am up to here, in pointing out this difference… am I formulating
an axiom?</p>
<p>Just one?</p>
<p>Like Nothing is Nothing, or Nothing is more important than Everything
— like they are the jokes or puns of?</p>
<p>It is just to see that those dimensions all exist on a single plane
of meaning. They can each be seen as sets which contain the lower: the
second dimension could be seen as a set of first dimensional points. But
we are not climbing. We haven’t actually obtained a metaphoreal bird’s
eye view, when we “ascend” from that secondary plane to this tertiary
dimension in which we can imagine ourselves above or below in relation
to it. We are still on the same level qualitively.</p>
<p>Prove to me that your understanding of higher dimensions is not just
an extension or “continuation” of this, of this pattern.</p>
<p>If you can do that, I might begin to understand what it is I think I
mean.</p>
<p>It is more than a paradigm shift. It is the world we need to get to,
and the one that is trying to get to us. We might need to <em>do</em>
something about it. We might need to <em>make</em> it happen, through
realization.</p>
<p>Do you think it would be the end?</p>
<p>I don’t. It has already happened. It has occurred in my life.
Time.</p>
<p>It isn’t a manifestation of any thing. It is not a technology.</p>
<p>It is the understanding of an idea. But it means something: it will
have certain effects. Maybe it is… probably it is. I am probably just
talking about fate or the wyrd. It is probably underway, anyway. I am
mad for having seen it. My error is then to anticipate.</p>
<p>I need to be patient, learn to let that not be suffering. Make this
better, more beautiful, more interesting, in the meantime. This
place.</p>
<p>Explore it more in story, properly. Forget the meta in the fiction.
Let it be.</p>
<p>Because that one dimensional leap — that is what all this is — it’s
not like it can happen again and again — then it would just be
quantitive, the thing I am saying it’s not.</p>
<p>I need to get my own fucking message man. Solone Starlingo.</p>
<p>That’s what I’m meant to be feeling before I even begin to work, to
play. That’s what I’m trying to say with Amulet, what she’s trying to
say to me: we’re in touch, don’t worry, chill out, relax, know this, and
then work, work from it — that’s what it means to figure it out. That’s
how the map of this place isn’t a map of a territory but an act of
deterritorialization (if what he meant was as Outlandish as he once
seemed to suggest) — it is more of an extended metaphor, but not as a
model, as a metaphorealization. Winding Brook Sanctuary for
Ultraterrestrial Life. Get out of your head Wayback, you’ve landed. Let
us come to you!</p>
<p>Autosave. Thanks machine. Dark grey and green.</p>
<p>Over and out. And never over and not not out. Under and in.</p>
<p>Toodle peeps!</p>

<hr />

<p>A ways back now</p>
<p>you were looking for your gloves</p>
<p>like finding your glasses on your head</p>
<p>you put your hands in your pockets</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>But it only <em>felt</em> like poetry!</p>
<p>But don’t fret, it’s all how it looks like and nothing is what it
seems.</p>
<p>You’ll find it again, poetry, it’s probably out there searching for
you now, only it has no hands and far too many pockets.</p>

<hr />

<h2>12:38</h2>

<p>Just fiddling around with the other day’s recording. Was it
yesterdodd? Fink so.</p>
<p>I’ve flip-flopped back on myself but you probably already noticed.
Yesterdodd I was going to edit this. I was going to do so sensitively,
but still I was going to… basically censor me. In everybody’s best
interests. But still.</p>
<p>Anyway, Doc, I guess you saved me. It was you. Maybe even in some way
the character Doc, in Thee Wylds, and thus the other PsillyBoy it was
based on. Hey dude! Yeah we’re all one big divided alien resulting from
a fantastic cosmic accident but we can only really prove it in our own
unspeshull waze isn’t it great? Heheheep.</p>
<p>But yes, I thought yeah but wrote yes, yeah, yep. Doc knows best.</p>
<p>I’m hoping — maybe that’s what tri-ing kind of is? — to be an
interesting patient, a right old case of it. But I have to give you it
all then, hey? Really let you make your own minds up. That shows how
much I respect you, really. Just quite embarrassing for me and a little
disgusting for you but it’s better than living in fear right?</p>
<p>I mean, I sometimes I imagine this is even the kind of stuff I really
want to read. And so where is it all? So, maybe if I share my own case
history I’ll get better at seeing when I’m taking a look at yours, or
something.</p>
<p>Obviously it’s not about analyzing each other really, but it’s
clearly a kind of Alien Psychiatry. Being Objective, really, isn’t
it?</p>
<p>Laing had his Knots and Lacan had his bits of string and we’ve all
got our dreams.</p>
<p>I like dreams.</p>
<p>I like reading other people’s.</p>
<p>Especially when I’m not really sure if they are dreams or not.</p>
<p>When they don’t even seem surreal in the reduced sense, but really
more-than-real.</p>
<p>Events. Happenings. Happeninks I heard. Inklinx.</p>
<p>So, fourth dimension it’s all right there isn’t it? The problem?
That’s my problem isn’t it Doc? The fourth dimension?</p>
<p>And so you’re going to give me a firth dimensional — firsth? Eek!
Firth? Fifth. A fifth dimensional… enema? Or just a suppository?</p>
<p>Or shall we just smoke somethink together?</p>
<p>Or shoot it up?</p>
<p>Bang bang yeah I’m making cowboy moves, well spotted.</p>
<p>But what do you do? If Time itself is apparently…</p>
<p>When time itself is apparently the metaphorealization?</p>
<p>Bang there’s a sphere bang there’s a sphere</p>
<p>Are we drawing lines between them or did we already have a kind of
cyclinder… silly, durrr. Cylinder.</p>
<p>Blah blah blah block universe worm people actual wormholes isn’tit
weird thank God someone understands me shall we have a drink?</p>
<p>Doctor Blake likes a pint of Porter doesn’t he? Don’t you?</p>
<p>Makes a change from the everlasting sup-sup-supper doesn’t it?</p>

<p>I’ll do something nice and sensibubble for everyones.</p>
<p>But send me yours.</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p>In the meantime.</p>
