<h1>13.</h1>
<p>We have flooded. I am listening to the sounds of my wife bailing us
out. The scrape of the metal dustpan on the rough concrete floor,
rhythmic &amp; with a little ring to it, then the emptying of the
bucket, repeat.</p>
<p>It has happened before but never this bad. We are thinking of buying
a proper bailer, whatever they actually use on boats. Is it a flood of
emotion, I wonder, the return of primordial powers?</p>
<p>Does the earth weep for the world? How are we to dry such tears? She
keeps on bailing out, the wind blowing through the house is a kind of
keening. Should I say something about the songs you sent me in the
night?</p>
