<h1>29.</h1>
<p>A few days ago we visited the grave of my father-in-law. While my
wife &amp; her mum tended to the plot I stood by the old stone wall
&amp; took in the view out over the fields that slip down to the river.
I was also very taken with the wall itself, the stones whitened by
lichen &amp; dotted with perfect little worlds of moss, islands of
comfortable detail I was only too happy to disappear into. At one point
I noticed a delicate conical snail shell trapped in a crack between two
stones. I amused myself with the game of trying to free it. It seemed
well stuck but by jiggling it with a couple of dried stalks I was
eventually able to get it loose. It struck me as very precious, a real
marvel, so I tucked it safely in the fold of my wallet &amp; carried it
home. I was sure it was empty but for a scrap of dehydrated tissue at
the far end. This morning I found it stuck to a pine cone I had collected
&amp; when I looked closer saw its tiny dark grey head spiked with a
couple of cute little horns. I will now find a place for it outside. It
reminds me of a proverb I picked up just the other day, from The Lady
Who Loved Insects, translated by Arthur Waley:</p>
<p>“For the ground between a snail’s horns what use to fight?”
