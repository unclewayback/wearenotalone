<h1>39.</h1>
<p>I appear to have become detached from my mythical origins. My advent
is in principle explainable with recourse to routine relative knowledges
like history, biology &amp; physics. No longer can I just step out of a
tree somewhere deep inside me &amp; come into being here, a vision
within a vision. The world has eaten my mythology &amp; in its place I
have been given a destiny, not something that it has been determined
must happen but something that can happen if I am determined enough.
Effectively, for the adventitious or non-indigenous person, for those
who have had the rug swept or sold out from under their feet: your
mythology is of the future. This is true even when, like the American
dream, it might seem to be of the past. Regardless, you know what it
comes down to. A here that is not here. A now that is not yet &amp; so
may never be.</p>
<p>For myself I have claimed a negative destiny, the sense of which is
that there is something that ends with me. This is a difficult thing
but perhaps through works such as these I am beginning to come to terms
with it. I can say that for me it is already over, my most necessary act
has been accomplished. Part of the difficulty is just in trusting myself
to say this, for it is no success in the worldly sense that even the
disagreeable may confirm &amp; my peers in this matter are mystics of a
sort, such that when I am able to put aspects up for review the most
positive result is their silence. I had sometimes thought of it as
taking something to my grave with me, like a hero managing to pull his
enemy with him over the cliff that they both may perish, now I realise
it was something I had to place in the middle of things, as if the
nature of night was a seed you could sow in every blink. Indeed one way
to talk about it is as a kind of edit, as if the centre of my life was
made sharper than the sharpest knife &amp; used to sever or perhaps
simply punctuate something. I am tempted to comfort myself with the
image of it as the first star appearing in the roof of the cave of
death, a sign of the outside world as the structure begins to crumble,
but such comforts also reveal the sense of suffocation they must seek to
give relief from. My only real comfort is in the nature of its
necessity, but even here I cannot rest for long, for it is not that
necessity who partners with the possible. Indeed, perhaps nonsense is
the only real relief, but of course only such nonsense as is the
truth.</p>
<p>Certainly it changes how I read &amp; must inform what I come to
write but the act, as I say, is done. Even as it was undone. This is how
I have placed my meat in the White Lady’s beak &amp; why I wake between
silken sheets woven from blackbird song to a morning without mourning I
can call True Love, &amp; promise to tell the tales of, without of
course ever being able just to give the game away. But I feel I should
say something of what it could mean for you. I can say there are some
things you will never get away with &amp; some things you ever shall,
&amp; that such a statement has very little to do with the laws of
nature. I can say that however far we go, however far we get, we will
never divorce the sense in which it was all right here. Was?</p>
<p>There is a was that may ever haunt us, that we may meet again when
the darks get deep, but once a was always a was even when it will
be.</p>
<p>There was a really bad story. It had great moments, in certain ways
it was better for me personally. But over all it was a tragedy, in the
end all that remained was whatever got lost. For all the glory of the
getting there in the end it was just a person — no matter how many they
were — standing looking back on it with their heart ripped out. By which
I mean they couldn’t even recognise themselves in what they were looking
upon. It was their story but they couldn’t see it, couldn’t feel it,
couldn’t put two &amp; two together for all their infinite sums. I think
it happened because they left before they were ready, which is to say
they left a mess behind them &amp; in the end somehow the mess caught up
with them, became a gulf between… meaning &amp; what might have
been?</p>
<p>No, no, what might have been was just a way of showing what could not
be, which was what it appeared to them they had become. You see there, I
suppose, how this is not the kind of story that can be said to go, nor
to have gone, anywhere. Even as that is precisely where it went.</p>
<p>I called for a kind of ship I suppose. For me it was a horse but I
guess I always knew it could be something of a ship for my
people. The ship came but it wasn’t the one I was expecting
&amp; did not appear in the way I expected. Perhaps after all it was two
ships, only one comes cloaked in the blackness of its not coming, the
other kindles gently in the heart, your own star to follow, the engine
of whatever you need it to be, but again: that’s not an easy kind of
necessity.</p>
<p>I am still here when the sun dies but I don’t know what that means,
at least literally. I don’t really believe in the literal, it forms part
of my disbelief in the world. You might say it doesn’t require belief
but then why is it not incredible? Which is to say How do you
<em>prove</em> it is a miracle? If the three of us are art science &amp;
religion you can see how we all come together here, recognise something
like an aim. Perhaps that is why I can’t define the metaphoreal/what the
definition is.</p>
<p>I can say that literally, had I not got on a literal ship, I would
not have found my True Love Story, but I suppose it is metaphoreally I
must tell you that my love was already true — no, I don’t mean it, I
only mean that my True Love doesn’t make other loves false: it makes
them All True. There are many ways to say this, &amp; no real ways to
fail it, still it is a test that has shook me to the core.</p>
