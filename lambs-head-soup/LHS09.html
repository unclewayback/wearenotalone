<h1>9.</h1>
<p>The other day I saw a bird, who happened to be a Chaffinch, at the
feeder. The voice said to me: All that is about that bird (&amp; thus
all that is really real about it) is what cannot be reproduced in it.
What cannot be reproduced about that bird is what it is. The voice
speaks very clearly &amp; exactly but perhaps there is always some
amount of translation going on. I amused myself by giving the voice a
biology lesson. Yes: No, it is not biology, it is a simple statement of
truth: what is, about the bird, cannot be reproduced.</p>
<p>This is a fact made of feeling that you are welcome to question &amp;
if you are in touch with the source of it it will answer you, it will go
on responding. It is this state that is intended. It is non-intellectual
while leaving all your critical faculties in tact. You don’t need to be
convinced by what you can feel very well is the truth &amp; what else
is faith?</p>
<p>But it strikes me that it cannot be seen. It can be heard because it
has to be listened to. It can be felt. But it is seen in &amp; as the
invisible &amp; this is what makes things beautiful, this is what
Beauty is.</p>
<p>What cannot be reproduced about me is not what marks me apart
from my parents it is what makes me the same as them. Such sameness is
difference absolved, difference in its purest form. It is the Absolute,
right there in that little bird, right here in me &amp; you.</p>
<p>God is a being speaking the truth, however silently or strangely they
may seem to say it: there is no mistake in it. God is the being, the
speaking, &amp; the truth. It does seem to come from elsewhere —
when it is me alone sometimes I am beside myself in another place speaking calm guidance
into the ear of this journeying body, the one in the trip, in time, under the
spell. It comes from Heaven &amp; it is always here. What cannot be
reproduced about the bird is the meaning of Eternity. That particular
bird, which to us lives &amp; dies, begins &amp; ends, &amp; is most
likely not so different from any other particular bird — what is truly
once &amp; one time only about it: this is the Eternal.</p>
<p>It is heaven on earth, which is so Good it is scary, but such fears
are very much preferable to anxiety. The awesome rock beneath all
terror, covered in this moss of creeping dread that some call language,
blooming with mushrooms of laughter, bursting corpse flowers of pure
reason. All gone to seed. A wave of calmness rolls over the garden
submerging it for a watery aeon of peace. Seaweed wavery peace, flitting
trancefish singing bubblesongs in what the world may perceive as the
depopulated goldfish bowl of your goneness…</p>
