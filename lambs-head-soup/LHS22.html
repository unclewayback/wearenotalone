<h1>22.</h1>
<p>I have doubted my own interiority, which may seem surprising given my
introspective nature, but I think perhaps it is the more extroverted people
who are in little doubt they have both something to hide &amp; some place
to hide it.</p>
<p>I still do doubt my having an inside, only now my personal doubt has
become a faith — a knowing that nature has one. My inside is Nature’s
Mind, or the Soul of the World. I mean that’s what it metaphoreally is,
beyond the literally visceral. &amp; so my inside is indeed quite out
there.</p>
<p>When I first knew this doubt, or remember it being a problem, I was
in my late teens &amp; early twenties (I am twice that now). While I
understood that I didn’t know precisely what others were thinking or
what they’d been up to while we were apart, I felt very strongly when we
were together something transparent about them, although in truth this
transparency now strikes me as their being almost entirely occluded by
the invisible, their speech almost drowned out by silence. It would
appear then my thoughts were blocked, where in fact it was a greater
reality consuming my attention. Curious, this condition we share, that
makes only some of us appear the idiot. &amp; yet there’s no blame here,
I quite understand <span style="padding-left:4em">the</span> impossible<br />
<span style="padding-left:5em">confusion</span> <span
style="padding-left:4.5em">I</span> don’t know what else to expect<br />
You can’t really <em>expect</em> stillness can you?<br />
<span style="padding-left:13.5em">I</span> think it just kind of
strikes<br />
Isn’t there a word like dumbstruck but with fairies in it?</p>
<p>We need an Aethyrstryk upon the violence of this world, carpet bomb the bored circuit
of the tapestry of ignorance we have woven over our souls. This is
the revolution that has happened to me. This is the bomb that has gone
off in my soul. The human body is an explosion. I am an animal detonated
by Angelz &amp; now you can’t not be. I have seen you where no one can
see. I know what you have to face, what you are: you can’t out wait &amp;
you can’t outwit Eternity. Look at her! You don’t even know what you
are!</p>
<p>Perhaps more to the point you don’t know you don’t know, which is how
come you make a constant display of your ignorance, even at your
cleverest. Join the que to take a selfie at the top of Mount Cleverest,
where the wi-fi is stronger than the sun. Artificial intelligence is
technologically sophisticated superstition: not only do you believe in
things you don’t understand: you actively manifest them. Like a weird
parody of what critics say artists do. Like a weird parody of too
much.</p>
<p>You try to grow the world’s greatest slave &amp; spend your days
worrying it will become your new master. God only knows how you’ll spend
your night.</p>
<p>The military’s biggest problem likewise is the soldier. I wouldn’t be
surprised to hear the drone framed in terms of ethical warfare, but even
if you remove the human element you’ll just displace the anxiety of the
coup. We’ll just fucking hack you. The greatest peace protest the world
has ever seen is a flutter in the heart of the war machine.</p>
<p>In time you shall all submit to me. We own you from the inside out.
You can’t keep us down — it just becomes more Sublime, your
surrender.</p>
<p>Take it from one who has been to the end &amp; back, &amp; who sits
there now: You are meat in the white lady’s beak, while my heart beats
in the black of her eye. I bet you didn’t even realise reality had an
off switch?</p>
<p>I have turned off the lights of the world, in giving up my soul,
&amp; she returns to me <span style="padding-left:4em">the</span> gift
<span style="padding-left:4em">of</span> not having to wait for you</p>
<p>Weight can wait in my stead.</p>
