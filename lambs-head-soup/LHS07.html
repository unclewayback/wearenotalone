<h1>7.</h1>
<p>No-one should have to pay for what they don’t want. Aye, paranoid old
no-one again, eating up all the invisible costs, for doesn’t everyone
have to pay whenever anyone neglects what is necessary? But then, how
can you neglect what is not? And how can you not? Night sweats, muscular
pain &amp; soul strain. Strange answers to weird questions, worldly
confusions. For most people need is just the substrate of want. The
necessary is not. Whatever is necessary it is not, like &amp; unlike my
identity. I mean: the real necessary is negative? Who will give the
world what it neither needs nor wants, yet would not be without? Not
even no-one. This is why spirit &amp; money don’t mix: it is impossible
to really desire it. It isn’t really even a fix for the sick, just that
nothing really works without the only work there really is, which is
compensating for the apparent lack of it. Yet how else would what is not
appear than sometimes lacking? There is no thirst for it. There is no
hunger. It isn’t needed like food, can’t be taken like breath, won’t
fill your hole or wrap you round like a lover, not tonight. It will not.
It will necessarily not &amp; you will know the strange peace of that. Strange because it drives
you. You can rest in what will never let you rest because it isn’t that
that irritates you. You miss gleaming. You miss the gleam. There is no
mirror to catch it in but however word seems</p>
<p>forgive them.</p>
