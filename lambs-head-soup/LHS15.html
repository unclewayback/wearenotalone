<h1>15.</h1>
<p>Don’t fall foul of the black &amp; white monkeys. Sky alt set circuit
against you. If you will but listen you are fit to teach all you need to
learn. After circuit is set back down: home. Love is the overreaction,
an ultraterrestrial love it will make you a fool to feel. I want to eat
beast. Cow pig sheep. I just don’t want to eat my friends. Bacon
slices of wife’s bottom. I am farting like a vegetable war is being
fought in my intestines. My stool chart is off the wall. Little black
&amp; white monkeys, Lemurs maybe, are they my enemies? Who is doing
this to me? Evil interdimensional black &amp; white imps running
interference all over my thought train. Will the eternal package be
delivered on time? Parp. Any one of those doe-eyed heart beasts could be
my companion. I would walk five thousand miles with you, knock-kneed
cow, I wouldn’t even ask for milk I just appreciate the quiet &amp;
sturdy companionship. My people are horrible don’t you think? With their
furry-faced over-familiars what run on a river of blood. If it’s not oil
it is blood. What is their problem with a nice glass of water? How thin
does blood have to get before it isn’t blood any more. This door’s dog
lives on reconstituted puree of next door’s cat who is currently busy
reducing sky population. Most people’s passion is a barren field.
Blindness. Where is the comfort in not seeing the horror of it all? I
wonder how many sporting rectangles of rainforest had to be felled to
pour me my morning soy milk? Maybe that’s why they’re setting off bombs
in my bowels? I’ll try oat next time. Protein can eat my shit. I’m
probably too old to need that much of it. Whitened prism flesh grown on
the tendons &amp; bones of a liberated exercise machine, hardly any
person left only not in the sense the slave masters are hoping, it’s
almost all turned to character &amp; the character has gone to seed,
windborne conglomerates no manager can manage, crazy cartoon characters
coming to life behind the eyes of insignificantly human faces, every
awkward little overcarrying who ever got removed from the great
equation: just subtract the problem part, delete erase or just keep them
distracted with ever-delayed promises of freedom, fake liberation in
some workless automated utopia, meanwhile keep intellectualising the
life out the truth, replace the real illusion with a pseudoscientific
simulation &amp; let their biology ravage them, let it twist them into
machine wannabees or meaty backwards nobodies, anything to avoid the
understanding — void the understanding — wordless — dissimilarity —
to nothing — only then — free from love — free to love — bound to help
— help</p>
<p>more or lesslessly</p>
