<h1>43.</h1>
<p>I used my eyelids to excavate a pond, cried for the moon until she
came. The look on her face told me light cannot be borrowed, but to the
world to which I woke it meant the buying &amp; selling of days.</p>
<p>I suppose I wait now, for that other world to wake me, but I shall
not wait passively, nothing is so beautiful as reality: there are things
I know about you that you could not tell yourself. I suppose I couldn’t
tell you either, only tell you it wasn’t necessary for me to know, &amp;
that it wasn’t revealing so much as revelation — still I don’t think I’d
say there’s nothing personal about it.</p>
<p>The owl pellet is the physical result of this work. Perhaps if I’d
got up earlier yesterday I could’ve told you a lot of what it meant for
me, but sometimes it is hard to tell the difference between failure
&amp; what isn’t meant to be.</p>
<p>I have to say, there is really a lot here, even in just a few little
lumps of what is basically the same stuff tucked away in a corner of yet
more. More of the same difference, kind of thing. It’s weird ’cos
sometimes even I think it’s not the kind of thing I’m interested in. I
suppose interest is far too weak a word. I suppose the only thing that
really helps me is there’s nothing I can do about it, even so there’s a
lot of things that doesn’t mean.</p>
<p>One of my favourite aspects of the owl pellet are the little whiskers
poking out of it. It makes it appear like it might still be sensitive,
but the touch is no longer directed by some wet glistening nose it is a
reconstituted chaos of perception, like looking into a puddle when the
wind disturbs your reflection only here it is holding still, the
disturbance has revealed something steadier, a firmness beyond
coherence. I ask myself, just for a joke really, if there isn’t anything
cute about it. Is there any cuteness remaining in this lump of voodoo dreadlock,
grey matted hair &amp; splintered bone? Perhaps it wasn’t me
asking myself but already the zombie rat perched bug-eyed on my shoulder,
who well knows I love him &amp; so find him kind of cute, my little wet
scab of a friend.</p>
<p>My smile is not to make light of the fact it turns my stomach (when I
watched it while eating yesterday it made me feel quite sick) but I
can’t deny there is something about it that makes me happy. Perhaps it
is that Christ where the cross is rot. Who imagines the Truth is always
symmetrical? Might the way of the world not be a kind of wonk? You can’t
just take the top off something &amp; call that Perfection, nor can you
make a slice of something &amp; call that the Good: You have to eat it
<em>all</em>.</p>
<p>Of course ‘you’ don’t. You can just go back to what you don’t even
know is sleep, waste your fucking life away &amp; take a few boring
cunts with you. Or do nice sleepy things too, of course, there are
plenty of those, plenty of interesting appearances to tend. Fun. Have
some nice sleepy interesting fun. Laugh at something a computer
wrote.</p>
<p>Delightfully Revolting, I’d say, if I had to sum it up.</p>
