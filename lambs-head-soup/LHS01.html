<h1>1.</h1>
<p>I don’t believe you. At least I didn’t, didn’t believe in you
yesterday, when you first occurred to me, floated one eye up in the
aether of my senseless touch.</p>
<p>Today I’m tired, it feels like you’ve gained some ground, like my
disbelief is going to be something I need to maintain rather than a
simple state I’m in, a way I tend.</p>
<p>So I’ll remind myself what I meant, the formula’s intent: it was
never to question your existence, it is the reality of you that doesn’t
ring true. You don’t feel right, right?</p>
<p>The way you feel is wrong. Not wrong like I feel today:
out of place, tired, upset. That’s how I feel so if it’s wrong
it’s the right kind of it. You it’s like you don’t feel. You just float
there in the broth, a little more salt, dead cute thing. Dead cute. So
cute I could eat you.</p>
<p>Is that the kind of wrong you are? Unkind enough to take me
literally?</p>
<p>The cat sat on the mat.<br />
The writer put pencil to paper.<br />
The head is boiling away.<br />
Morning has broken.</p>
