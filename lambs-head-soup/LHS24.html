<h1>24.</h1>
<p>A change of scene, seems to make no difference, perhaps the change
happens too gradually, too continuously. Seems to make no difference but
how else could you be coming home again, &amp; with the sun at perfect
strength behind your eyes, the real-rose tinted spectacles. Perhaps the
only real spectacle there is: homecoming. But when the aliens arrive,
which is to say return, there are no great crowds gathered to welcome
them, no confetti clouds blowing around their ships, only your open
heart gone sea anemone in all its delicate strangeness, only the
question of what all this is, &amp; the mysterious knowledge of the
answer, a feeling unspeakably gentle, the spell to lift all spells.</p>
<p>There is something here now, whether I like it or not. I mean that
previously I have worried about investing too much in any particular
earthly location, tying myself down, but also making what I felt would
be a grave error: conflating what really matters with any particular
state location person time or thing. Well, there is no conflation, the
centre is everywhere, but nonetheless something is happening here &amp;
I would be a fool to deny it. I shall be a fool to enjoy it, too, but
there are fools &amp; then there are fools. None of this is big &amp; I
still wouldn’t make the mistake of calling it visible but to me at least
it is palpable. However humble it may be, or even feel the need to
remind itself of being, one mustn’t underestimate the magnitude of
calling for peace in oneself &amp; hearing the answer: there is no other
power. No power over this, no power over you that know this, no power
over us. Indeed it sounds very negative, it is a power we do not have,
such power as has the flower we might trample underfoot: the power not
to spring back. The force of being completed, which says not that
everything is over but that we’re only just getting started. Perhaps
always, in a way, surely there is plenty room for tragedy here as peace
of course is also beauty. Beauty is always a little melancholy, just as
true happiness is never without a tear in its eye. We don’t grow old in
such beams, we are born ancient. This event is the only moment there is:
may your life contain many such uncontainable not-things: only what
we’ll never pin down can set us free.</p>
<p>The greater the illusion<br />
The stranger shall salvation appear</p>
<p>There is no normal here<br />
For it is no ordinary</p>
