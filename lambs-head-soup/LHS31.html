<h1>31.</h1>
<p>Rise to the top of the pile &amp; you get to enact democracy in your
own inimitable style! Me I’ll crown this great hole where the earth used
to be &amp; be done with the lot of you. I have sheets of paper with
more dimensions than your most advanced steamrollers. Me &amp; space are
like this. Since, like, wayback. Jesus said it wasn’t what went into a
mouth that defiled a person but what came out of it. If only opinions
really were like arseholes people probably wouldn’t have so many of
them. It would be easier to hear then wouldn’t it? Easier to breathe.
Better for everybody. Regardless of whatever may defile who there’s
something of a parable you can turn yourself into. The more nebulous a
thing is the more widespreadly in-your-face non-existent small talk the
gas bag you need to get your vegetarian bum away from, the more
acausally everywhere the incomprehensible knot you’re trying to say
<em>not quite</em> to… the more reason to just make it something
objective you can (perhaps not so) easily give up.</p>
<p>I’m giving up eating meat but that’s just like a symbol for what I’m
really giving up &amp; I’m doing this because I’ll never give up. I’ll
give myself up before I give up. In fact that is part of this too: I’m
giving up my flesh to someone. Maybe you’ll meat her, maybe more on that
later, maybe you already have, maybe not — if it’s definitely maybe then
definitely not!</p>
<p>I don’t want to stop really but that’s good because if I did it
wouldn’t work, wouldn’t be a sacrifice.</p>
<p>Not in my name is part of what it says, which says to those who are
what they are in name only that they’ve been getting away with it long
enough &amp; their time is up. They’ll be no more ticking in this little
box. I’m setting off my blackbird sirens &amp; firing all my wrens at
you, a strategy in the song of the robin.</p>
<p>I’m leaving a little fish-shaped door open just in case it all goes
pear-shaped but that’s not an escape hatch unless you stutter. It’s the
way I came in.</p>
<p>There is no outside.</p>
