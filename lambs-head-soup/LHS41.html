<h1>41.</h1>
<p>I have no idea what the ordinary is, except that it be the
extraordinary. It is as if, instead of the weather, our small talk
consisted of the details of our continually being visited by all manner
of rapidly evolving birds — as if you could nary purchase a pasty
without offering an account of what appears to be a new form of seagull.
But the parrot on my shoulder is quick to point out that continual
novelty might be a misleading way to characterise the ordinary. But
that’s just it, I say, don’t you see Quark? The utter freshness of this
strange consistency is the signification of all true nonsense, because,
by Jove, if what <em>is</em> the reason needed a reason it wouldn’t be
reason at all! But you are quite right, it is probably better for me
just to make some remark on the weather &amp; limit myself to the
singular very when they ask me if I’m well, lest my apparently unfounded
enthusiasm should give them another impression. Thank goodness for these
more unlikely outlets beyond the crumbling facades of our now sadly
imaginary high streets. I make perfect sense to the mob of tiny
hummingbirds who animate my elbows, &amp; even the dullest of sparrows
shall doff their caps in my seed strewn wake, as I sling the
sledgehammer rhythm of my happy work song towards the crumbling arcade
behind the drifting dunes of the changeless beaches. Forty days &amp;
forty nights I have been battering this pendulous weight against the
tarnished bank of gambling machines, &amp; now all the glass has
returned to sand &amp; the faces have slipped off the coins to recover
the eyes of their owners &amp; the cheap circuitries that housed their
flash routines have melded with the structural molasses of their
mechanically wrought malthought plannage, such that the entire design
has been rerendered potential &amp; might now make some sufficiently
advanced magpie a rather fine unhooking utensil. I know not why I am
happy but I can tell you for certain it isn’t myself that I am pleased
with.</p>
