<h1>45.</h1>
<p>When I ask what I’m feeling this morning the feeling itself is a
question. Without searching it wonders, it looks me about. The sun comes
out more, saturating the barn’s terracotta roof. I could just list the
things I’ve seen, the half-thoughts I’ve tried on for size that
collapsed back into this unapparent question, silly words like world,
reality, truth, pathology. I guess it’s not even a question. No, it says
it’s not. It’s a little bit sad but noticing that tends to make it flash
happy, like a fish in a stream whose wholeness you weren’t quite
seeing. A wink who repeats what the moon can make you say: There is no
such thing as borrowed light. The feeling is deeper than those which are
still too close to thought, or which are disturbances caused by
something like attempted sayings or perhaps that force which pulls them
towards tellings. I’m not sure there is anything left that you really
want to figure out for yourself, it is more a doubt regarding its making
sense or being of use to anyone else, &amp; perhaps some misguided
impulse towards justification.</p>
<p>Do the beings you love need to justify themselves to you? Do you seek
to make sense of bunny &amp; wife? Do you need to explain house &amp;
garden?</p>
<p>No, but I need to be sure of that place I cannot go, the area I hold
myself back from, the realm I create by not going there.</p>
<p>Then anarchy is precisely an ideal for me, but it is an ideal I quite literally make a
space for: it is less ‘anything goes’ than ‘no go area’. So long as we
can respect the no go we can go on with anything. We do this well
enough, the no go becomes our going there. Who goes there? I will
fictionalise them as a group of Supernatural Scientists. But if this is
a fiction I ever will write, it will be because I have founded Thee
Wylds in my own ‘Real Life’.</p>
<p>The great parks &amp; such, the national parks, they are too much
like reserves: little (even when big) portions set aside so the mass can
continue its march. Like your head: you can do what you like in there
just don’t confuse it with how you must behave according to the reality
of my civilization (you poor little social construction). Or like a
smart phone: a little piece of something rich people own &amp; control
for you to carry around with you, just enough to keep everybody happy
(which is to say most people conveniently depressed &amp; anyone else
effectively maddened).</p>
<p>Thee Wylds will be just a little patch, a random corner of the land
that has in fact already suggested itself &amp; become brambled over.
But you don’t need land to do this, all you need is Sanctuary, &amp;
whatever that is it is something <em>you</em> have to be. Maybe it is
this bit where you aren’t that really makes it. It would be easy to give
the wrong image, or the right image but the wrong idea: I speak of a
garden with the wilderness inside. No borrowed landscape possible
because it’s all garden, all yours, there is no outside. But that
doesn’t make the wilderness surrounded even if you can apparently walk
right round it: it’s a hole in reality. Sure, you know this stuff,
you’ve seen it a million times, just that probably what most of those
times have done is make you think it a fantasy, a ‘metaphor’. A metaphor
for what?</p>
<p>Reality is a hole in reality, just you can’t really go there until or
unless you’re true. True as a corpse ain’t lyin’. We found this kind of
wilderness &amp; it’s that kind of ruin. Not a place to go cycling, not
a picnic place or photo opportunity, nowhere you can hunt. You probably
can’t even go there, it would be easier to push the world in through the
pinpricks of my pupils. You probably can’t even go there but can you
stop it from entering you? You who do those things we never agreed you
could do, those things we would really rather you please do not do: I
plant this black seed in your so-called reality: There is a line you
never shall cross, not without dying &amp; perhaps not even then. Magic
is the power of the powerless.</p>
