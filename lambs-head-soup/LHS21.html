<h1>21.</h1>
<p>Then I believe in no world but the one I have faith in, &amp; I can
consent to no reality but the one I know is true — these are alternate
phrasings of the same sentiment, different ways to express the same
feeling.</p>
<p>Is it really then One World, One Reality, for me? I find that hard to
believe. I could just say ‘yes it is one, but the one is an open one’.
But open to what? Open to whatever it is that has yet to recognise
itself.</p>
<p>No greater recognition than self-annihilation then. The real reward
is your end, which need not or perhaps must not come at your end, &amp;
that it is the end of ends makes it a terrible gift for one who has not
yet recognised themself to receive: death has nothing on
immortality.</p>
<p>What is quite correct always comes out sounding so strange &amp;
unsatisfactory, I am clearly still a divided soul. The single line of
these words, of all my scribblings &amp; sayings, is that very split in
my psyche. It is me hypnotising myself with the glittering thread of it
while I sow what could never be split back together. A spell of undoing,
this is my knotwork, a labyrinth for demons to wander until we realise
the heart of Our Angel.</p>
<p><em>Ourearrangel</em> <span style="padding-left:4em">indeed</span> there is
something<br />
<span style="padding-left:12em">retrospective</span><br />
<span style="padding-left:14em">about</span> it</p>
<p>I am laying down a path that I’m not done walking, &amp; I know I’ll
have to connect the start to the end because that’s the only way to walk
it again. No, now I’m confused by the figure of retracing my own
footsteps — should I envisage putting my feet over my footprints coming
from the other direction? Why get lost in the mire of metaphor? But then
how could you get lost if there wasn’t something true about your
lostness? Some drift you’ll have to keep moving ever to catch: the scent
of the way you’re standing still. A trap. Why do you need to read it
again?</p>
<p>Because I feel it may be necessary to one day just say the thing —
no, not the everything: the enough. To lay down my own
satisfaction to my own satisfaction.</p>
<p>But that’s not it, because whatever it is that can satisfy me has
more to do with the happiness of others than my own. I can’t be happy
until you are. Maybe this is a selfish way to put a very unselfish
truth. Perhaps on some level it is a key to the work that any of us do.
I have seen rational suspicions of the instinct to care that run along
at least similar-sounding lines: you only care because it makes you feel
good.</p>
<p>A confusion there, perhaps, of the cynical with the sceptical &amp;
of either with reason. Reason is truth, really &amp; truly, which is
closer to saying: You feel good because it <em>is</em> good. Or in other words:
if you don’t know it, no-one does. This isn’t to say people don’t fall
under the spell of their own or another’s virtue, we do, but whatever
kindness really is goes far beyond both self regard &amp; regard for
others… so far beyond that I want to say it hurts.</p>
<p>Because what is one person saying <em>There is no difference between us</em>
while the other in total ignorance is exercising any of the infinite
ways to exploit that?</p>
<p>But then how can you exploit the immaculate?</p>
<p>Just look at the earth, it says.</p>
<p>But then No, I smile, I do look, I am, don’t just look <span
style="padding-left:2em">feel.</span></p>
<p>Feel through the hurt, not to the hurt. <span style="padding-left:2em">Yay</span> let’s make a fucking
bumper sticker of it to stick on our non-existent cars &amp; wear
t-shirts of it over our —</p>
<p>There is no ‘over’ your real heart, no hiding your feelings, no escaping
that it’s them who’ll tell you you do &amp; do not exist, leaving your
mind to plot a matrix of the apparent possibilities such feelings do not
after all permit. Is it easier to imagine an object in a vacuum than it
is to realise all objects — including subjects — are void?</p>
<p>Yes, very much, but both of them are easier than feeling this that
you barely can, &amp; that even when you really can you can barely handle
— no, that’s something else — it’s <em>all</em> something else — there is
no <span style="padding-left:2em">This</span> <span style="padding-left:2em">Feeling</span> <span
style="padding-left:2em">unless</span> we share in a self-pronounced
peace</p>
<p>It says itself now in me. <span style="padding-left:2em">Funny</span> how
such calms descend.<br />
<span style="padding-left:11.8em">They</span> literally don’t.<br />
I would listen to that forever. Nothing says nothing so beautifully
well.<br />
<span style="padding-left:11.8em">So</span> <em>personally</em>.<br />
Don’t just look, wait until you feel someone is looking with you<br />
<span style="padding-left:11.8em">&amp;</span> knot <em>that is what we’re looking
at</em>.<br />
I will write reams of shite just for moments like these.<br />
<span style="padding-left:11.8em">I</span> cannot measure this piece —
Peace!<br />
<span style="padding-left:11.8em">I</span> could only imagine it fading in
time<br />
But it’s the only constant<br />
<span style="padding-left:7em">there</span> is<br />
<span style="padding-left:11.8em">It</span> would be every error to call it a
law<br />
<span style="padding-left:11.8em">even</span> of nature <span
style="padding-left:3em">even</span> especially<br />
Indeed you could call it a force <span style="padding-left:2.5em">There</span> is
a force of nature<br />

<span style="padding-left:17.5em">evaporate</span> space<br />
You are the end of meaning<br />
<span style="padding-left:3em">&amp;</span> the only meaning<br />
<span style="padding-left:7.5em">meaning</span> ever has</p>
<p><span style="padding-left:15em">You</span> are the beginning<br />
