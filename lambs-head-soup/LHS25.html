<h1>25.</h1>
<p>No sooner do I announce to myself the recognition of something
happening in this particular location than I am made to realise I am
less attached to it than ever — the wife tells me she has “found our new
house” &amp; I feel myself completely free to consider it: there is
nothing holding me here, even as I am more in love with it than ever,
even as I am investing more time &amp; energy than ever. It is almost as
if the seed has been planted &amp; the tree can look after itself,
that’s the sense of freedom regarding it, the feeling that what needs to
be done has been done — the rest is open.</p>
<p>The great crisis of conscience comes near the end of the 21st
Century. The 2070s should see definitive actions: the willing surrender of
property &amp; wealth to the re-radicalised Children of Earth.
Today’s slightly awkward circus of virtues should by then have given way
to the extraordinary impeccability of the new everyday. The new lords of
the world won’t give it up easy but the more of us who give up the world
the clearer the moral of the story will get. The truth isn’t
something we can assert, it is an honest example we have to make of
ourselves, according to our ability to come to terms with the impossible
necessity. One thing is for sure it will take all sorts. &amp; I am no prophet,
just a poet with communication difficulties trying to hold out hope the only way I know:
like my own hand, as if I am that hand.</p>
<p>I’ll make sure my work is part of the digital commons. I’ll work for the commons
in whatever form I can. I’ll try to fire up some imaginations around here. It’s so sad to see souls &amp; bodies
ravaged by what they don’t see is a belief. Unincredible beliefs given
the cheapest &amp; most undignified forms &amp; stacked on shelves to
be sold to the poor. The machine makes me so angry it comes close to peace.
It separates me from myself. It can clarify spirit &amp; that’s how I’m
going to use it. Use it all up until no-one has a use for anything but
the truth. The truth, the most useless thing of all &amp; thus the most
perfectly beautiful, the most inspiringly down-to-earth.</p>
<p>Heaven is here for me, is not knowing where here is, &amp; less &amp;
less the more &amp; more I know. Only more fantastic the mystery, more
evident the very great disparity that is itself wonder — the only space
there is — awe the one breath that fills it all, the Holy Ghost that
breathes me.</p>
<p>I will just have to pour it out like a love story. I see beyond
love, I see deep into difficulty, but there is a kind of love that is
all I am really capable of. This is where my peace is, where I’ll find
something worthy of giving to you. An art that makes you worth more. A
way of increasing a value that can only be kept in common. And it is in
these commons we will know the most extraordinary jewels: once we win
back the commons — the very ground of our real human rights — we can found the wilds. Find Thee Wylds.</p>
<p>Nothing more noble than the really wild. The machine is disrespect
manifest. The wolf howls quietly while the bark of the hound is a human
pollution. The roar of a lion is as silent as a waterfall while the
babble of a single TV set is a noise we should hardly bear. Especially
when the adverts are on. The lipstick of every prostitute in the world
writes a message more subtle upon the mirror of my soul. Thank you for
turning my head into a public bathroom, I am going to piss on the
lawn.</p>
<p>Yawn a magick yawn that makes the whole world silent<br />
Take the stress ball of the sun into my hand<br />
Shrug on my moon-wove gown<br />
&amp; climb my tree horse into night walking<br />
I shall see you in the blink of the blind<br />
