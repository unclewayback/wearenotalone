<h1>8.</h1>
<p>I know you’ve come a long long way with this question burning in the
hole where your soul used to be so let me try to answer it for
you:</p>
<p><em>What is the Absolute Cute?</em></p>
<p>I don’t know. I guess it’s like The Absolute Truth if this was a game of
Cosmic Charades &amp; I was doing a <em>sounds like</em>, but then that would
imply I knew what the Absolute Truth was rather than just suspecting I
can’t not know what it feels like because it must be like the deepest
truest part of me who cannot be mine alone —</p>
<p>I don’t know, but since you came all this way…</p>
<p>It’s not a style. Not the cutesy, nothing that can be marketed.
Magnetic but not really attractive. It’s your Cheshire Cat Animal Mother

&amp; become wise — but this wisdom is the bomb blast
of your annihilation — a light that comes on when the candle of everything
is blown out — a spark that kindles in your mind — burns — burns bright enough to read by
— a story about a hand from the other side — such strange long fingers —
ever reaching out — in — stillness always already there — appearing at the last moment</p>
<p>to broken wing you back across the burnt circle of</p>
