<p>Does the soup have a geometry? I wouldn’t have thought so but when I
did then think about it it appeared that it could. Could be said to.</p>
<p>As ever you don’t have to look long to find a circle: the cauldron,
the bowl, the spoon — plenty of candidates. The knife will do for a
straight line, carving its little distances between whatever the points,
a triangle there at the tip of it. &amp; lo, we can even find a
square: one corner in the liquid of the soup itself, one corner in the
fire that heats it up, one corner swirling in the steam that rises from
it, one corner cut into little pieces &amp; floating about.</p>
<p>Clearly there is at least an attempt at something <em>like</em>
Reality.</p>
