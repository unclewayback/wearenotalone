<h1>26.</h1>
<p>Here I am, sure of a faith that is not blind, &amp; yet when I ask
myself the question of it — who testifies? I wonder if it isn’t more so
that my faith has become totally blind: I led myself to the ledge of
whatever was possible for me to know, to see, to be — &amp; over I went,
over I am, over it is. But who says this?</p>
<p>A beginner. But you’ve come some way if you can call yourself
that.</p>
<p>I begin right here, yet again, at where it seems I can’t go on. But
the brick wall is my best friend: so long as I am, you are always there
for me to bang my head against. Literally the rock speaks for itself:
all the earth is a testimony to reality, just in a way it is impossible
to think, or not to think, say there is always at least one miracle left
to witness — for the miracle is witnessing itself — but what does this
mean but the absolute antithesis of watching yourself watching,
observing the observer or observation itself.</p>
<p>The antithesis. The surpraxis. A discombobulate monk. None other.
No.</p>
<p>Yes. The rock speaks for itself. Even my knowing is the word of
another. The hare is more the creature of imagination than the unicorn,
yet without the unicorn the hare would not exist, else would only exist,
same thing. The animals profess my own faith. Everything they feel is
pure. When death happens &amp; they mourn, their suffering is salvation
because it is totally satisfying. The sky quenches every thirst because
the sky testifies, it speaks for itself, it tells you everything you
would ever want to know, the rest you can tell yourself you tell
yourself:</p>
<p>Once in a dream my vision stayed behind to watch the meat peripheral
plucked from its field</p>
<p>my belief in my own death is a testament that my life has a
centre</p>
<p>light is a tree with its roots in the earth</p>
<p>the jewel is a particle of dirt</p>
<p>space speaks more solidly than its stars</p>
<p>Who am I to judge the horse?</p>
<p>The green of the grass is not a beauty competition</p>
<p>But perhaps it must remain the devil, imagination: let those who
imagine they are good turn the truth into attestation. <span
style="padding-left:4em">Strange.</span></p>
<p>Who is the liar then? Perhaps you just slipped, after all there are
certain ways only you can push yourself. You meant to say: turn the
truth into an assertion.</p>
<p>For it is true that the light asserts nothing, &amp; it is clear that
there is no-one in turn who is asserting that. But the light testifies:
there is a judgement in its speaking for itself: that the light says
light is not a tautology but a judgement, indeed perhaps the last. Then
my root is no mistake but the true foundation: an impossible act of
discernment which sets you up as your own judge: testimony is the heart
of your understanding of honesty: you have judged nature wholly
innocent<br />
<span style="padding-left:16em">You</span> are not certain<br />
<span style="padding-left:16em">guilt</span> can even be proved<br />
You know that art proves itself<br />
Art is a way you constitute your own proof<br />
It is the testimony of the human<br />
<span style="padding-left:12em">It</span> is also a judgement upon
them<br />
<span style="padding-left:12em">hence</span> your gift is one none can ask
for<br />
<span style="padding-left:12em">&amp;</span> you are horrified to
see<br />
<span style="padding-left:13em">even</span> in your perception of
beauty<span><br />
<span style="padding-left:13em">an</span> accusation<br />
Yet it is pure smile<br />
<span style="padding-left:5.3em">to</span> say<br />
<span style="padding-left:12em">Who</span> is to blame for this
beauty?</p>
<p>In speaking with the devil I am understanding God<br />
<span style="padding-left:12em">—</span> the only comfort is a hard
truth:<br />
<span style="padding-left:13em">The</span> Holy Spirit will not console
you<br />
<span style="padding-left:13em">(not</span> if you are me, at least)
—<br />
<span style="padding-left:12em">I</span> am understanding how nothing can be
added to that</p>
<p>Yet I testify to its being<br />
<span style="padding-left:16em">All</span> &amp;</p>
<p><span style="padding-left:7em">Nothing</span> rhymes with
orange<br />
<span style="padding-left:12em">but</span> my face upon the plate<br />
<span style="padding-left:12em">of</span> how sweet it will be<br />
<span style="padding-left:7em">For</span> Our Angel to eat</p>
