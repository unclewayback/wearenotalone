<h1>33.</h1>
<p>Lamb’s head soup is in some sort of cauldron, but the real cauldron
is all in the lamb’s head. If there’s one thing infinity is not it’s a
continuously growing thing. A continuously enlarging finity I mean. That
sort of never ending is what we come to call the over &amp; done. The
universe is not unlike the real world — the earth say — this body of
ours that is all in your head. A chicken sitting on an egg is enough to
shatter every illusion. Just now a little bit of me emerges into a nest
lined with angel feathers: you have to really not care to feel this
much: if you can’t help but be careful what are you being?
Conscientious, comes the answer, a beautifully hairy caterpillar inside
the ugly butterfly of consciousness. As if self-annihilation was a
delicacy so priceless it became a tiny meal served to rich people,
little more than decoration on a plate: if they were eating atom bombs
that would be my kind of restaurant. What is the realisation that that’s
all consciousness is? A footstep in the gemmed grass: worlds are shaken
from their stems &amp; eaten by the earth, worlds tumble from the skies
making a meal of light, worlds retract inside their shells &amp; do not
think of waiting, worlds hear your prayer, worlds vibrate inside your
head, worlds beg for what they cannot bear to ask for: is this your
apology? Silence is that prayer which is the music of making good, the
beautiful disappearance of your godhood as if the literal shrugging off
of a cloak to reveal the wondrous nakedness of mind’s light as nature.
You shall not shiver, you shall come as nothing into my arms &amp; I
shall not hesitate to break every rib of my words until my heart burns
hot enough for you. Let us move now a little distance from it, the
shameless energy of stillness burning still, the fierce strangeness of
that fearsome cuteness: Look! I know you see it but when I turn to
register my smile it is a window I am looking out of, a window I am
looking into, my smile is a spacequake, a fissure through which I
witness the universal baby shake, a dream dancing behind its eyelids
like a flicker of recognition, the second thought of a mind that has
never seen but that the spirit is what we are swimming in, every breath
absorbing the ghost of a person like a sentence left hanging</p>
