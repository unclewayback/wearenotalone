<h1>11.</h1>
<p>The raindrops on the windowpane are on the move today, or at least
some among them are. The general tendency is downward, in conformance
with tendencies in general. Isn’t it sweet how gravity has just the
lightest touch? I shouldn’t be too surprised to see her roll one up as
an expression of her delight. I’m sure I could handle such a delicate
glitch, in a sense it has already been explained away, which is perhaps
to say we have given permission for it to happen: it’s okay, darling, if
you need to be a freak — we’re all a little improbable!
I guess it would seem like when a
satellite drifting across the night sky makes the stars move, except
your little contravention would make my whole world</p>
<p>— stop —</p>
<p>&amp; start flowing in
reverse. Your little going against the supposedly spatial grain would
send me sliding backwards in time limbs flailing in my fathomless void
fixed to the spot until you begin to curve near the top, seeming to
pause as you come through the double glazing &amp; down towards my left
eye, disappearing into the duct there</p>
<p>another tear I’ll never cry.</p>
