<h1>42.</h1>
<p>Yesterday after finishing my duties on the Echoing Green I made my
way back through the Fairy Portals, a swampy neglected area we
are gradually reclaiming from the tangled blackthorns. It borders the
yard of our noisy neighbour &amp; sometimes smells of his poisonous
products, we still haven’t finished digging out the sheets of black
plastic that lie buried for god-knows-what reason in the earth. In spite
of all this, or perhaps because of it, the place already has a certain
magic.</p>
<p>It was a brilliantly sunny morning but the portals themselves were
in shade making the sparse dappled light
look whiter &amp; the shadows blacker. The contrast was beautiful &amp;
dazzling, especially where it picked out a frond of fern or caught in a
cyclamen flower. I saw a blackbird disappearing beneath some straggly
unkempt box bushes where a bright red azalea shone with the sun. Somehow
it was as if the flowers I was seeing were the memories of those seen by
him &amp; by this feeling I knew that he had indeed seen &amp; in his
way appreciated them: it wasn’t just the wife &amp; I who were enjoying
the garden, even the apparently purely aesthetic aspects of it. I knelt down
&amp; looked at those flowers for a while, shining like red lightbulbs
beneath an arch of sporulating fern. I could imagine the eyes of all the
birds in our little world as a kind of midnight dew reflecting the vast depths of space
&amp; somehow condensing the stars into a tiny spark which kindled the
vision of this garden, spreading out from the fairy portals like a kind
of beautiful oil spill. Indeed as I trod the flooded path — little more
than a channel dug in the mud — through a small portal of honeysuckle I
watched the bacterial oil that collects in such places rippling with my slow sloshy footsteps, a
kind of lubricated sky. Standing beneath the hawthorn in front of
the small pond with its golden sunshine willow &amp; ornamental quince
was the silhouette of the rotten trunk I had erected, which over the
years has become a place to make offerings: whenever I find the
corpses of creatures (or accidentally produce them myself, such as the
very occasional mouse I neglect to release from the until-then-humane
traps) I bring them here &amp; give them a sky burial inside the jagged
woodloused towers of the trunk. Quite the range of little souls by now:
electrocuted newts, hoof-trod toads, ejected baby sparrows,
sleeping leverets, paused blackbirds, belly-up voles, mummified shrews. I
made a crude &amp; simple carving out of an interesting branch of pine I
once found &amp; it stands on top as a guardian. It reminds me a little
of an old viking idol of Frey I once saw, although my carving is more
modest, seeming to hide its sex by the merest turn of a leg. It used to
have eyes but they fell out. What surprised &amp; delighted me this day
was the appearance of an owl pellet stuck somewhat precariously
to one of the towers in such a way as to suddenly
present itself to me when I had finished examining the effigy. It has
been many years since I last saw an owl pellet, I was a child in fact.
My grandad & I were such regular visitors to the local owl sanctuary that
he was allowed to carry an extensible pincer pole
that he would use to collect pellets from the cages. When we got home we
would take them apart &amp; examine all the
tiny bones, taking particular delight in the skulls. One day I was
swooped on by an Eagle Owl. Perhaps I got too close. Up on their stump
they seemed more than my equal. It is less like a memory now than a
dream, although I can still picture the cartoon my grandad drew of the event
all I can feel from my own point of view is the spread of those great wings
blotting everything out.</p>
