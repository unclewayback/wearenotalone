<h1>3.</h1>
<p>There is something of my faith in the blank page, such that it isn’t
belief — as perhaps many might understand it — so much as an incredulity
concerning that which is added. It really is more like doubt, or perhaps
scepticism.</p>
<p>I might’ve enjoyed your soup just fine — I take no issue at all with the
hot water part. But let me stay with the blank page a minute:
It is part of my art to imagine myself an unblanker of them:
I like to decorate, I like to write, I like to experiment with marks &amp;
media. A memory may arise, get added: cleaning the old enamel cooker
top, losing my patience with some cooked on goo, going at it with
the scouring pad: I get rid of the crust but I scratch the enamel. It makes me sad
— there is no going back — this old thing will keep deteriorating
until it is useless &amp; with this mark I have basically inscribed this
fact, drawn myself a picture of it to look at every time I cook.</p>
<p>There seems little doubt about this mark. Perhaps because the adding
is in part a taking away? More likely because it already accords with
certain beliefs I have concerning Reality — common ones induced by
common experiences: what is done is done &amp; any form of undoing must
begin by accepting this.</p>
<p>Might <em>end</em> otherwise, mind.</p>
<p>The smile in that sentence is a sign of my faith. It is these kinds
of marks that I find most convincing. More convincing than any logic, you
understand? Quite beyond reason. Yet subtle enough. Not idiotic. You
could reason about it, just I would only find it convincing if it had
that smile, if it was able to lay its hand on me in a certain way. It’s
reassuring, but only really because it neither is nor is not reassuring.
It’s true. Somehow the page is still blank. The smile was already on
it.</p>
