<h1>20.</h1>
<p>Somehow she’d managed to put me under that spell most people call
reality. Most of some people. A spell of the <em>life is short</em> variety.
Perhaps it was my fault for making her think of death, regardless soon
enough the trees were springing up like grass &amp; we would be wrinkly
by tomorrow. Every in-between seemed predictable, the future felt like
something we could plan for. Even death, which is never not inevitable,
seemed like something you could find on a menu.</p>
<p>One of the things it makes you want to do, seeing the rest of your
life laid out for you, is to fill it with experiences, generate a
variety of memories to make the time feel longer.</p>
<p>Most every day we’ll lie on the sofa after lunch &amp; cuddle. Once
you’ve cuddled one cuddle you’ve cuddled them all, haven’t you?</p>
<p>The mind just goes on drifting, like clouds. Only they’re not clouds
are they? They’re exhaust fumes from the sacred boony rarebitz
spicecraft. You can see his gentle essence in everyone, sense the
presence of the dust-hidden stars. It must be some kind of hydrogen
engine, quite right dear.</p>
<p>How do you show the invisible? I was asked that by an Irish-American
shepherd in the night. I discovered him through his music, long slow
minimal electronica that he audited while popping pills &amp; smoking
spliffs &amp; tending sheep, always at night. Night shift shepherd.
No-one had ever taught him music or magic, he just had it, it was part
of how he cared, part of his being aware of a web he was part of, never
more so than when he was alone. I guess his sounds were another kind of
field, one with uncountable sheep in. How do you show the invisible?</p>
<p>The boony rarebit has died in this world &amp; now travels through
space. He has a photo of mummy &amp; daddy in a heart-shaped frame on
his dash. We are travelling through time to a death-like point — in fact
it is more like a cut I have already made — a cut that is like
the tiniest slice of time there could possibly be, this is the real
missing time &amp; it is no time at all. You make a slice like this in
your life &amp; Eternity plants a seed. This is the seed we shall carry
through death &amp; plant in turn on our new eden. If you know how to
make yourself welcome how could you not be welcome?</p>
<p>Perhaps it is indeed a species of sublimation, if so it is an
antidote to the poison of repression. I am not filing off my canines. I
remain murderously raging &amp; male, whatever else I am, whatever else
I’m not. I’m not in control but I’m working with it, working with it
like a person, working at it like a garden, working on it like a
book.</p>
<p>The Absolute Cute is a new sublime for the 23rd Century, if you need
one.</p>
<p>Sure I suffer from all kinds of delusion but none of them can touch
the truth. Touch, the truth. How can you not feel you? Even disembodied
I dream. Dream of people being kind to animals while people go on
killing people, while slaughter machines rove — discombinate
antiharvesters — while waves of whoevers break upon the walls, burn
themselves alive outside the embassies.</p>
<p>I was glad I watched your video in the end my friend. You are clearly
a lovely person whatever the character assassins say, just as
clearly as they lack character themselves. You are good &amp; kind &amp; I
hear your cry &amp; understand your distress. I am grateful for that hug
with your cindered spirit. I do not believe in a world that does not feel it.</p>
<p>I will ever have faith in who does.</p>
