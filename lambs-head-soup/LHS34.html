<h1>34.</h1>
<p>Some way downhill is a giant chicken shed. Our neighbour, a
farmer, had it installed last year. He’s invited us to come &amp; see it
&amp; I was hoping it might happen somewhere in these pages but it
hasn’t worked out yet &amp; now I’m not sure it shall. It’s free range
so I don’t have to imagine a total chicken concentration camp
but I presume it still seems like living inside a giant death machine.
It remains a meat factory. Apparently when the power went out in the
storms they lost 4,000 chickens because the ventilation stopped
working, which suggests it’s rather badly designed. Our neighbour
seems at once to be somewhat proud of it &amp; a little resentful at
having been manipulated into building it, it seems whoever pays his
bills has him by the balls.</p>
<p>Up on the hill just past the local village is a death camp for cows.
It is one of the ugliest installations around &amp; it has quite some
competition. The government pour money into it &amp; dead cows come out
&amp; go into everybody’s mouths. It isn’t just meat being eaten: they
are the poor of the animal world, the slaves. When they built the thing
they cut down a bunch of trees &amp; there it sits, lord of denuded
fields. It’s horrible.</p>
<p>You don’t even realise you’re connected to it. It’s like a little cog
spinning in a distant field. Oh look, you say when you’re having a walk
one day, a tiny windmill. But it’s not a very windy day &amp; still the
thing goes on turning. It has been placed there deliberately to
contravene a kind of natural law. Such laws cannot really be broken but
going against them appears to some to be to their benefit. The presence
of this little spinning wheel makes you part of a machine. The moment
they placed it there they changed what you were without your realising.
You think it doesn’t really matter because there are so many things in
front your face that matter that much more, but the thing is none of
these things matter a jot if they’re part of a machine. You might not
see it but it is demeaning you. It is sucking the life out of everything
you love.</p>
<p>Here, all you need is to put one of these down. A hand plucks a
flower &amp; places your feet upon the ground. Or was it <em>the</em>
feet upon <em>your</em> ground? The ground is the place of your feet at
any rate, your feet are not replacements for the ground. Nothing to
stand on but understanding. A pebble balanced on the lip of the ripple
it caused. The body of God is antigravity. What is this what is
this what is this floating in? The reality is the truth must be
imagined. The meaning of life is that which renders all our attempts to
give it meaning absurd.</p>
