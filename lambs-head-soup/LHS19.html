<h1>19.</h1>
<p>The first time I remember ever being truly repulsed by meat was the
moment I found a hare’s leg in the grass, some year’s back, a month or
so after having released Little Odin, the first hare we cared for &amp;
raised after he was wounded by a lawnmower.</p>
<p>I can think of many reasons why I loved that animal so, enough of
them embarrassing, but whatever really bound us went beyond reason,
&amp; so it is. When I see a hare, I see family, I see a deep &amp;
strange part of me, I see too much.</p>
<p>It was a back leg, mostly still covered in fur but with some flesh
&amp; bone near the top at the joint. I was dismayed &amp; disgusted,
disappointed in myself. I felt someone foxy was sending me a message,
saying I raised him too human, made him too slow &amp; soft. I
understood nature as callous, as having no place for a word like friend,
at least whoever’s friend mattering less than the fire in the belly of
the beast. All of a sudden I condoned civilization, I agreed that we
should build a wall around ourselves &amp; manage things according to
our principles, the pinnacle of which seems always to be love. But if it
was love it wouldn’t be up there, the pinnacle of a pyramid
of principles with a wall around it, a holy city of gentle freegans
with a meat factory of war-struck migrants clamouring to get in.</p>
<p>But then boundaries is where love happens. Walls of love &amp; grief,
portals of trauma. I should remind myself it is not really the world I
am trying to make sense of I’m just exploring some thread of myself,
wandering the corridors of maybe some kind of message looking through
the windows of wow. Perhaps it doesn’t matter. Not in a bad way more
like a flower. A flower has no skin. My limbs are petals, the beat of my
heart the drawn out memory of an insect’s wings, nectar my blood, my
brain a cloud of pollen, nowhere is not colour —</p>
<p>It wouldn’t make any sense if I was trying to convince anyone of
anything or make some social commentary or fabricate some
recommendation. As the ramblings of a hard working mad person it makes
all kinds of sense. In the heart of certain secrets it rings as true as
what cannot be shared.</p>
<p>I have wondered if I have killed even by simply eating meat. Perhaps I
failed Little Cloud, our zen bunny, or I would have if pure joy could
ever fail anyone. He died last April. I have promised to write these
tales properly some other time, as you know such words as these are
threads in a broader tapestry, maybe even the living carpet of some
boundless room where the bookshelves are trees still &amp; the words run
with sweet sun water like veins in leaves.</p>
<p>I cooked a joint — probably pig — that I bought because it was going
off. I put the oven dish outside for the rats to lick &amp; that night
heard fox for the first time in many years. They reminded me of a story,
something between the hares &amp; the bunnies, &amp; I set out trying to
write it — maybe that was Lent last year? — I couldn’t write it. I
started but I couldn’t keep it up. I conjured foxy but then I never put
them back away &amp; if there was a story there it wasn’t long before
they finished it. Left me a little bit — back legs again — to put in the
ground &amp; remember.</p>
<p>If there really is a tree in Eden whose fruit gives the
knowledge of Good &amp; Evil I think that fruit must be flesh. Perhaps
it is a tree the body of God is buried under. Their bones becomes the
wood &amp; their nuts become the nuts &amp; that’s why I’m nuts. Why we
are insane, I mean. Such trips are so hard to handle the knowledge leads
to ignorance, which is always somehow wilful even as it’s a given.
Imagine if every blink you had to peel your eyeballs like grapes &amp;
drop them into your own insatiably self-satisfied yawn. You would cry
such sweet nectar the angels would become insects just to sop you up.</p>
