<h1>10.</h1>
<p>In the calm after a storm — or perhaps between blowings of it — I
hear the voice of the buzzard, high, &amp; look out through the double glazing at
the blue morning, the dark barn caught upside down in every drop upon
the glass — all things I can believe because I don’t have to. I think
of working in the storm, snatching up armfuls of hay for the horses
&amp; trapping it on the wheelbarrow with the pitchfork so the wind
doesn’t rip it right away — cold hard rain smacking my back as I carry
it to them — I am harried &amp; cursing but at some point I will laugh
with the wildness of it all, realise I am not not enjoying myself. I
think of donning my spacesuit &amp; going out through the airlock to do
something a drone should probably do, seeing a slow spiral of cloud
spinning over the earth down below, syncing with the generative ambient
techno I play to cover my anxiety-triggering tinnitus: free of the
planet’s surface &amp; feeling more shut in than ever. Part of the old
ruin comes tumbling down, a great noise &amp; a rush of hooves as
liquified everything smashes all at once into the window. Bulletproof
glass &amp; then some, crystal-balled controller of nothing speaking
sweet nothings to their psychedelic houseplants as the universal
gyroscope readjusts to another pancentral perturbation. <em>Come in
birdsong do you read me?</em> This is yard wren one sir, ready to fire
in sparrowchirp — three — two — one!</p>
