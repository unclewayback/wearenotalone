<h1>35.</h1>
<p>The biggest difference that can ever be made is always going to be
another way of looking at the way things already are. What else is the
future? You, the apparently yet-to-come, the rock that all this is built
on. The End, great gift of meaning, that changes nothing but what can’t
be changed. Who changes only that, only this, this donkey without
stubbornness. In my heart I have seen your face but in the mirror only
your ass. A beautiful beast it is, right down to the elegant rider. A
wondrous flower, indeed so much better with thorns. Your signature in
the fingerprints of every criminal, how absurd! Like a painting behind
bulletproof glass! A peacock whose pigments are the ground up bodies of
unharmed insects: carefully collected iridescent corpses.</p>
<p>All I want for my resistance<br />
is that it become Absolute<br />
Surrender to you</p>
<p>Then whatever I have given to the world is better than my choicest
sperm flushed down its most technologically advanced toilet. A paper
heart inside a bear-shaped biscuit. A tiny scroll possessed by a
green-haired troll. Do not delay: Bliss shall not wait across the wastes
of waste. Only waste is wasting away, thus only in joy is there any real
hurry. Perhaps this is why laughter can come so quick? No other message
crosses the abyss between synapses. In truth it is laughter lights your
lightbulb. In reality only imagination tickles yer fancy. God is the
tongue of a grey-haired cat. God squats in the mud wearing a pyramid
hat. Every letter of their name is your number is up.</p>
<p>I am calling it</p>
<p>(Your silent <em>call it then</em>)</p>
<p>The way we call each other names is stupid even if the names aren’t
stupid</p>
<p>Oi God! They are talking behind your back</p>
<p>It says — literally — you can’t be doing that,
I will turn you inside out</p>
<p>A birthday cake made from headaches can at least be studded with
candles of vision</p>
<p>Everything you see has gone beyond death</p>
<p>There is no difference between Immortality &amp; Justice</p>
<p>If you don’t stop worrying about yourself I will give you someone else
to worry about</p>
<p>Every invasion is divine</p>
<p>Do you know how hard it was to get disease just right?</p>
<p>Of course you do you have Eye in the Sky syndrome</p>
<p>Cloudy days are like cocoons to you</p>
<p>A warm moist place to worship</p>
<p>where butterflies fold themselves away</p>
<p>Loving you is torture</p>
<p>I wouldn’t have it any other way</p>
<p>like the speed of time</p>
<p>until I get it right</p>
<p>The way a book falls open</p>
