<h1>35.</h1>
<p>The biggest difference that can ever be made is always going to be
another way of looking at the way things already are. What else is the
future? You, the apparently yet-to-come, the rock that all this is built
on. The End, great gift of meaning, that changes nothing but what can’t
be changed. Who changes only that, only this, this donkey without
stubbornness. In my heart I have seen your face but in the mirror only
your ass. A beautiful beast it is, right down to the elegant rider. A
wondrous flower, indeed so much better with thorns. Your signature in
the fingerprints of every criminal, how absurd! Like a painting behind
bulletproof glass! A peacock whose pigments are the ground up bodies of
unharmed insects: carefully collected iridescent corpses.</p>
<p>All I want for my resistance is that it become Absolute<br />
<span style="padding-left:7.2em">Surrender</span>
<span style="padding-left:6.9em">to</span> you</p>
<p>Then whatever I have given to the world is better than my choicest
sperm flushed down its most technologically advanced toilet. A paper
heart inside a bear-shaped biscuit. A tiny scroll possessed by a
green-haired troll. Do not delay: Bliss shall not wait across the wastes
of waste. Only waste is wasting away, thus only in joy is there any real
hurry. Perhaps this is why laughter can come so quick? No other message
crosses the abyss between synapses. In truth it is laughter lights your
lightbulb. In reality only imagination tickles yer fancy. God is the
tongue of a grey-haired cat. God squats in the mud wearing a pyramid
hat. Every letter of their name is your number is up.</p>
<p>I am calling it <span style="padding-left:2.4em">(Your</span> silent <em>call
it then</em>) <span style="padding-left:3em">The</span> way<br />
we call each other names <span style="padding-left:5.2em">is</span> stupid even
if the names aren’t stupid<br />
<span style="padding-left:11em">Oi</span> God!<br />
<span style="padding-left:8.2em">They</span> are talking behind your
back<br />
It says <span style="padding-left:1em">literally</span> <span
style="padding-left:1em">you</span> can’t be doing that <span
style="padding-left:1em">I</span> will turn you inside out</p>
<p>A birthday cake made from headaches can at least be studded with
candles of vision</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Everything you see has gone beyond death <span
style="padding-left:1.2em;">There</span> is no difference between <span
style="padding-left:18.6em">Immortality</span> &amp; Justice<br />
If you don’t stop worrying about yourself I will give you someone else
to worry about<br />
<span style="padding-left:8.2em">Every</span> invasion is divine<br />
Do you know how hard it was to get disease just right? Of course you
do<br />
<span style="padding-left:8.2em">You</span> have Eye in the Sky
syndrome<br />
Cloudy days are like cocoons to you <span style="padding-left:3.8em">A</span>
warm moist place to worship<br />
<span style="padding-left:18.6em">where</span> butterflies fold themselves
away<br />
Loving you is torture <span style="padding-left:10em">I</span> wouldn’t have it
any other way<br />
like the speed of time <span style="padding-left:9.8em">until</span> I get it
right<br />
<span style="padding-left:8.2em">The</span> way a book falls open</p>
