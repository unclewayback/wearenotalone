<h1>37.</h1>
<p>I was far from the house, wandering around in a rather thick morning
mist. Apart from a few spikes of rush &amp; some softly jiggling
spiderwebs strung with dew everything was distant. You couldn’t see me,
my body wasn’t apparent, but what was clearer even than usual was the
distance between things. Distances, you should say: the mist makes
clearer all the different distances. But you are haunted now, by that
singular distance. You are seeing a beautiful spider’s web, like a hammock
strung between spikes of rush, &amp; it is jiggling a little bit in a
wind you cannot feel, a breeze that seems little more than an echo of
some still sleepy person getting out of bed. You are haunting this
spider’s web. What do you want? You don’t want to see the spider, what if
that’s you? How soon would you get over the horror? How quickly could
you come to complete awareness as a spider? What are the speed of its
breaths? What are the capabilities of its limbs? Is it like being a
human ear turned inside out, covered in little hairs through which you
feel you hear? Do you feel hollow, a black ghost haunting a world of
dark tunnels?</p>
<p>You don’t want to worship the spider as a god, but you will if you
have to. You want to admire its handiwork. Dismiss this vague sense of
narcissism, it is but a shadow of the sun of knowledge that will in the
end obliterate it: inside the mist every dewdrop seems to have had all the
cloud burnt out of it. How strange it is to imagine you could assemble
drops of such perfect clarity as these &amp; come up with something
apparently cloudy! The problem is something you can barely admit to
yourself because it seems even more ridiculous. You don’t want to admit
it. If you admit it you will have to admit all its friends as well. Is
there often something lonely about the ghost? Even always? Something
lonely about you. About you. Cloaked in the company of something so
beautifully repellent I can’t see what it is, like the skin of rain.</p>
<p>I am reduced to measuring things, counting the drops I’ve already
counted just to make sure nothing’s changed, but throughout this there’s
an awareness I maintain that it may just be a method of passing time. I
don’t want to say there is something insane about it. Do you? Do you
want to insist there is a madness in time? I want to count the drops
again, to be sure there is only one. I want to measure the distances
between them to confirm they are in fact the same. I can see it is not
the case, in what seems like an unbroken moment: the drops are many
&amp; the distances are obviously different. I can see it. But you can’t
see me.</p>
<p>It is you. It is you &amp; I can see myself in you<br />
&amp; all the different yous in each of you<br />
all the same</p>
<p>I blink like not being awake at night &amp; open my eye inside every
drop in this little old limited field &amp; I see you walking across it
going back inside the house but I can’t touch the walls of your head
without breaking down.</p>
<p>Is that what I want? Not to break down when I touch what isn’t there?</p>
<p>To haunt a work of art<br />
not only the artist<br />
must die</p>
