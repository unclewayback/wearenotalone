<h1>5.</h1>
<p>What is necessary for me is not necessarily necessary for you, but I
think it is necessary that it is in some sense chosen, committed to. I
believe the truly necessary entails a kind of vow. Perhaps the vow of
vows. Not to eat Lamb’s Head Soup is not the vow I have taken. I cannot
tell you the vow I have taken — it is in many ways still hidden from me
— but I can tell you that not to eat Lamb’s Head Soup feels to me like a
consequence of it, something that has become necessary in light of it,
in light of that which remains somehow dark to me.</p>
<p>How can I have vowed, or have chosen something, truly, &amp; yet not
know what that something is? Well, for one thing: I do know, that’s what
this is, it’s just that knowing is a feeling for me: this may not be a
vow that you take with words. For another thing: it means, or seems to
mean, different things depending on the situation. I didn’t really even
realise I was writing about it until today. One last thing: though any
true vow must be taken freely, the freedom that underwrites this vow
feels somewhat otherworldly. I believe it may only be found at the nexus
of certain forces, a location from which worldly perspectives may appear
highly constrained.</p>
<p>I won’t eat Lamb’s Head Soup because the creatures are my kin. Moral
relativism is not the end of morality it is the matrix of it. All this
is built on kinship relations. Such relativity is a face of the
Absolute. Perhaps the vow is given &amp; taken as an Absolute
Relation.</p>
<p>I won’t eat Lamb’s Head Soup because of what it is, which is also
what it symbolises. I need to stay as far away as possible from the Meat
Factory while I hold myself against it.</p>
<p>I won’t eat Lamb’s Head Soup because of the whole bloody mess. They
sound like they’re saying <em>Yaay</em>, to me, when they bleat. Those
cute little sounds drift across the fields &amp; make me smile. I talked
to my wife about it, she said that when she used to be a vet she learnt
we didn’t eat them yet: we waited until they were teens (so slightly
less cute) &amp; killed them then. I’m not sure peace can come to a
world that eats meat, I told her.</p>
<p>I’m not sure peace can come to a world that eats meat, I said to
myself. Of course it can, you idiot, I said, Peace comes to whoever goes
to it. It comes to who it comes to, always Absolute &amp; never total.
But I know what I mean, I know how I feel, I know what my lord is saying
to me, I know what my Peace is, what this Peace means.</p>
<p>I couldn’t even imagine it. Well, I could, it just seemed even less
real than the angels &amp; demons, fairies &amp; aliens, I might
sometimes imagine I imagine. Lamb’s Head Soup: I don’t believe you. Cute
wrinkly pink head boiling away. You don’t feel right.</p>
<p>So I had to wonder about that, if it wasn’t a sign I was making some
progress: I knew Lamb’s Head Soup existed, that it was something the
world did: it was out there, somewhere in that consensus reality I don’t
recall myself ever having agreed to: Lamb’s Head Soup, I could find it, see
it smell it touch it taste it, hear one of the main ingredients calling
just now across the fields, inexplicably: <em>Yaaayyy</em>.</p>
<p>It just doesn’t make sense to me, emotionally, &amp; this means that
it lacks reality, at least for me, it lacks reality. Maybe that’s why I
went crazy, before? I think now: I just didn’t believe in people, in
their world, not nearly so much as I believed in myself &amp; the voices
in my head &amp; the pictures in my dreams &amp; the feelings in my soul
&amp; those other strange people who have apparently given time to or
followed their own.</p>
<p>So I’m making progress, because now without going crazy Reality is
reorganising itself along another axis or according to a different
dimension, like depth but not really: feeling. I’m not sure feeling
really does space &amp; time like most conceive dimension. If you had a
flow of feeling in a certain way then wound another around it you would
&amp; you wouldn’t get a whole new feeling between &amp; beyond them. At
any rate you could never package them up &amp; then replicate them &amp;
put one pack there &amp; the other over there &amp; say time is somehow
in the gap or passage between them. I just mean that to feeling dimension
means something more like meaning &amp; so if there’s a point it’s
basically You, which I am too, &amp; so if there’s a line it can’t be
the one between us &amp; them, &amp; so on.</p>
<p>So Lamb’s Head Soup, which is part of the world &amp; exists in
consensus reality, is less real to me than certain feelings that said
reality may label subjective, &amp; thus the world may categorise as
fictions what to me are more facts than fact. But to grasp the import of
this you have to see the entire Meat Factory &amp; all its products —
one of which or some of whom you &amp; I might be — as actively becoming
illusory. Concretely: what many people take to be the Real World seems
more like an illusion to me than ever. &amp; The earth herself erupts in
an almost apocalyptic-feeling imaginality, a realer-than-realness. Existence becomes wondrous — it is 
no longer your everyday, run-of-the-mill stuff — &amp; yet there is nowhere it isn’t.</p>
<p>Apart from where it’s not.</p>
