<h2>07:38 Winding Brook</h2>

<p><em>Tasting nothing, a glimpse of the spider’s old skin…</em></p>
<p>Don’t feel like writing, so just processing some old — or not so old
in this case — recordings. This is funnest to do when it’s something
surprising and interesting I’ve forgotten about, and least fun when it
is some long low energy ramble I somehow compel myself to listen to
again, just in case. It is only figuring out when to bother that
matters — that I don’t get that is sometimes enough to make me want to
junk the whole thing off... otherwise, other times, it seems like it could
have some value.</p>
<p>But, and this importantly: used sparingly. What I need to achieve is
like… a drop of this, then a good wadge of more or less personable
straightforward communification — chatting in the most sense-making and
welcoming way I can manage — combined with good prose, potent poetry,
moments of quiet natural silence, and appropriately paced music.</p>
<p>Because this is the way in, somehow. Or a video, is. This,
metaphoreal, is deeper, and the log here the fool plunge… and all this
in service of building something else, getting somewhere (grow ling now
here twit twoo get her).</p>
<p>&amp; defo learn to worry less about not speaking, leaving space, as
well as actively feel (d?) recording — need more textures and stuff:
thought was that people will have to be listening, if they are
listening, and so will listen to the quiet just as well, or even more
so… also a drop of chanting and song is well and good, you is freak,
remember — the only appearsons n undorterz who is gonna get you is
we.</p>
<p>(recall being so confuzzled by all the relative rights and wrongs of
being among the many different loves and strifes we call family, and the
That by which one finds ones centre or self in said place — basically
the way we weigh emotionally, all those not not logixxx of pheeling that
leave us reeling… how it can sometimes seem that any more rational way
of decision-making is on the run from this, quite rightly, but also —
also this is more the level on which the world seems to (not) work, than
the rational. The political seems to be but a hijacked awryness of it,
the scientific can’t come near it, and the creative somehow comes
out of it (still reeling) — only something like religion (but not religion)
might somehow engage it directly, prophet-ably?)</p>

<hr />

<p>Cold! Strange to catch sight of the new moon just above where the
lightning struck hawthorn used to live.</p>
<p>Thinking of poetic reduction. I myself give reductionism short
shrift, who doesn’t? But in this age of apparent information… I mean,
there is a way in which What elfs is wisdom? I guess this is something
more alchemical, like distillation. I was going to say filtration, but
we want to lean towards the intensifying aspects, more than the idea of
removing anything — the idea being that nothing really important is
removed, or lost, anyway.</p>
<p>So this is neither subtractive synthesis, nor additive analysis, I
blah.</p>
<p>Clearly it is alchemy, metaphoreally, so why resist? It is life lived
and lived. Maybe it is portal tech?</p>
<p>It is not information theoretic. We are not reducing or compressing.
We are gaining, by shrugging off — the fundamental moves are quantitive
paradoxes, that make perfect qualitive sense.</p>
<p>Apparently Blake’s Vala is very compressed, and this is one of the
reasons it is so difficult yet so rewarding. We don’t want to compress,
we want to make choices. We want to be aware of… gateways, sure — of
paths. To say one can picture the gate, is to imagine the path there for
the taking.</p>
<p>But if I carry on like this soon enough I’ll be talking about music
and gardening.</p>
<p>That’s the idea.</p>

<hr />

<p>Also, here in Eurotown, I notice much swaying around Englishness,
Britishness, Albionicity… it’s all good, I understand — but it’s not <em>it</em>,
not right, not me. I don’t want to make the mistake of that kind of
identity, of some sort of misguided nationalism or tribalism — I am also
not a globalist, necessarily. Anyway… for me what I am is something I
am, and one can certainly see national-seeming characteristics — English
eccentricity or a bit of British, what? deflationism or something… But
it is so far from the right way up, to focus on or identify with that.
And very dangerous, or just a bit stupid or something, to imagine there
is something that needs saving there, by our celebrating it, or
whatever. It’s a bit like anarchy, for me: whatever is of a people,
itself a blurry and strange and interesting story, in me: it is nothing
I can identify with, and nothing I can lose. It is just a way of things,
and any attempt to — or most attempts to — bring it out or do something
with it, unless ironic or meta in the sense of having some kind of
awareness of all these issues, which my Albionic Man was meant to have…
except also it was angry about constructionism, wasn’t it? It was saying
what I was just saying, about the innateness or just-is-ness of pluralic
peopledom, and yet it was using this to argue against social
construction, when in fact it is not against such: substrates of things
are only against stuff as a foundation is against the building that sits
on it… we don’t really want to disidentify then, either, and the not not
was at least partly about this. It was our focus in the vast field of
the neither nor…</p>
<p>Anyway, you don’t show you are English, or celebrate your Englishness, by
flying a flag, or by having a hand-waving statue of the Queen on your
kitchen windowsilly — if you are something, you cannot not be it, and
this is so important, even as it is ‘given’ (just how it is), that its
simplicity needs to be defended: one needs to stay aware / not lose sight
of it. Because otherwise ‘people’ will try to make you into something
that you already are, and in such processes we can only become what we
are not: fakes.</p>
<p>(Those things that we are not that we are, interdependently arising
as we, or much of us, or the us of us, be — this, these, is our not not:
the metaphoreal. (Stuff like: I am not a squirrel. In f*ct you is not
not a squirrel. But: I am proud to be English? You do not even not
exist! Something is eating your soul! (Just a General Eye Deer to Beer
Ware wiv!)))</p>

<hr />

<p>The other thing I was thinking is that I would like to get away from
this half-here writing, this kind of mad <em>sketching while I’m doing or
should be doing something else</em> — but then I was like: but it is fine, as
part of your process, it is just not necessarily something you should
share. My main criteria should be a kind of care for the reader, in
publishing. Perhaps the only way to do this will be to draw a hard line?
This, for me, my diary, where I do not have to think that… and the
published the published, where all thoughts of my own entertainment or
needs are summ-eerily dasmashed?</p>
<p>I think that could be wiser. Then the release schedule we came up
with yesterday would be the what we publish, of this process. My diary
stays diary unless I say otherwise.</p>
<p>Because I sometimes even wonder if I am being kind to myself, going
on as loosely as this. I allow that I am, thinking I get to a stage
where this becomes something I move on from. I want to get to a place
where even writing my diary, or log, is an act given fully to itself — a
prayer or meditation, basically. For this, I smile, not to have to
<em>not</em> be silly — it sounds so lofty and serious — it is not about
being grave or not — it is just about the degree of presence, of
attention. Of care.</p>
<p>This is the ‘dissimilar indifference’ my shnake hisses and lishps
aboot, shirley. I give full care and attention to this particuliar mode
of sharing which is never not about connection yet must happen largely
in, what will probabbley remain mostly unknown as, thee (yes, why knot?)
Alone. The sharing is more than immediate, and yet occurring with you who
cannot be simply or only here and now. It is according to this, that we
feel the core of what we are up to is writing, a kind of writing. The
mode of care is very much care, but it is a caring in the mode of paying
attention — there is something inherently neutral about it. On another
level it will be caring, doing my best to be objective (or simply firm)
with myself, so that those of you who do pass this way, do so neither in
vanity nor in vain.</p>
<p>For the time being I suppose that what I release will bear more
relation to these logs than not, for it is the writing itself I must
seek to transform. The aim is an act, and this comes before, or
transcends, any idea of utility. Same way we sometimes walk the line, or
begin to realize we are walking a line, between cause and effect… or
above and beyond them.</p>
<p>Being here and now means more than just taking a few breaths and
calming down. Peace means so much more than this. Peace means too much,
just rightly.</p>

<h2>10:24</h2>

<p>Quick note before I get back on with the tiling in the bathroom. Chou
saw Mederic this morning, gave him his whiskey — bottle of Jamesons this
time. Apparently their chicken installation isn’t a concentration camp
of featherless fatties in cages, but at least free range — label rouge —
if not organic/bio. He said we should come have a look, so that’ll be
good. Glad it won’t be a birdy hell down there!</p>
<p>Also at least two other people were struck by lightning (funny as it
was only a three flash storm). Mederic and his lot were struck, again it
was their phoneline that was hit, and he mentioned one other fellow saw his livebox
jump three metres across the room (which reminds me that when I opened
the cupboard to check the fuses two bottles fell out, obviously having
been jiggled forward by the boom field. It was my two bottles of wild
cherry rum — that which gave me the glorious shits at the end of the
cuckoo’s callbook! They didn’t break, just bonked on the planks.)</p>
<p>We’ve just been out placing the trees we got from the garden centre —
winter sales — the other day, all in Capability’s: a golden hazel,
another red sentinel crab apple, a fancy fagus (beech tree) and a
purple hornbeam.</p>
<p>I’m off to do the joints between the tiles: I just pulled off the
ones that were coming off and somewhat roughly stuck them back. Sorting
the bathroom was an idea from my White Tornado session and is just
meant to be an improvement for a few years until we can knock the whole
thing down and build something better. It’s really hell, in winter in
particular, and far from inviting at the best of times.</p>

<h2>18:32</h2>

<p>I’m quite enjoying this non-internet, or unternet, or twatever it
int.</p>
<p>I would like to search for some things though. Bohlen pierce. Just
intonation… maybe I can dig out my Harry Partch? Is that his name? Got
him around here somewhere…</p>
<p>(oh yeah, some primroses out, the witch hazel by the pond, a few
first bulbous sprouts n shite)</p>
