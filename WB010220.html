<h1>21st February</h1>
<h2>07:04</h2>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">At the edge of the interdependent web<br /></span>
<span class="line">wherein word means because bird means<br /></span>
<span class="line">that we are welcome to shut the front door</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">What Is shuffles into the unspidery nonlight<br /></span>
<span class="line">to buzz with a chaos of flies<br /></span>
<span class="line">that should conjure eternal life as much as</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">An edge or some sort of bridge. But seriously<br /></span>
<span class="line">Bertie, how could the web, or net, not have an edge?<br /></span>
<span class="line">Wouldn’t it have to reach some kind of limit</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">in order to interrelate, interrogate, inter the deep end…<br /></span>
<span class="line">in the first and last place? Excuse me, I sneezed.<br /></span>
<span class="line">Merci, you blessed me. Bertie?</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">Okay Row-yer-boatie, let’s try this (gets out his compass)<br /></span>
<span class="line">—Oh don’t, please Bertie, not another circle again!—<br /></span>
<span class="line">Calm yer sen brethren, this is a middling one.</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">This circle significant eyes a theoretickle solocation<br /></span>
<span class="line">wherefrom the line itself is a term, say word say,<br /></span>
<span class="line">and the inside and outside are relata.</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">The minimal relations, call them tiny dada andna<br /></span>
<span class="line">minimammy. Can’t thee word sun now shine?<br /></span>
<span class="line">Cannot the daughter of thou world hersen devine?</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">I don’t see why not. Can I call you Umbert?<br /></span>
<span class="line">I read the silence both as aquiescene and an<br /></span>
<span class="line">invitation         to actually         think.</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">I’ll say yes, but sigh maybe. Think myself this<br /></span>
<span class="line">word-child, child word. Wonder, which is tiny dada?<br /></span>
<span class="line">Who is minimammy? Outside or indershins?</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">Prick myself with a point of origin again, somewhen<br /></span>
<span class="line">deep in the still present past within my apparesence.<br /></span>
<span class="line">You can be tiny dada, but I doubt you’ll be my first word.</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">Me-ne-ma-ma, did I utter you? Were you not just outside<br /></span>
<span class="line">but what there was before there was outside?<br /></span>
<span class="line">The outside outside, the conditions for all this to begin</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">to begin with? The plain old plane before it was<br /></span>
<span class="line">scrabbled at? Umbert, this is just the same old<br /></span>
<span class="line">circle mush, whodya fink you wuz kiddink?</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">The idea, Row-yer-boatie, was first to see this<br /></span>
<span class="line">child first, like you did in a way, creating<br /></span>
<span class="line">its parents. Then what?</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">Am I supposed to acknowledge that each of them<br /></span>
<span class="line">must have been somebodings child? Easy to see<br /></span>
<span class="line">as some kind of tree, say we’re all circles say,</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">in the end, and looking back unto our roots is<br /></span>
<span class="line">endless branches. Endless branches.<br /></span>
<span class="line">This is a kind of edge, isn’t it? Vertiginous</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">Abyssish. The branches branch, split, keep<br /></span>
<span class="line">curling curling wider — how could that not<br /></span>
<span class="line">come back around? Not knot? Me up? Your turn?</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">Silence. Aye. This could be an edge. And the other?<br /></span>
<span class="line">Seemed harder to see. If tiny dada was my original<br /></span>
<span class="line">prick, could he have had a child inside? Have been</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">a child once too? Wouldn’t that make me<br /></span>
<span class="line">His Mother? The minimammy of he? Now it is she<br /></span>
<span class="line">who seems tricksy, never content to lie between,</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">ever-displaced by pricks and their boundaries,<br /></span>
<span class="line">chaos of the keeps on being Cosmic Context.<br /></span>
<span class="line">Context with no content but my discontent.</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">But how could discontent be Cosmic? I’m a fog.<br /></span>
<span class="line">This isn’t the tree you’ve given me. I’m a pond<br /></span>
<span class="line">and it’s a pebble. What if</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">I am a pond and it is a pebble? How could I then<br /></span>
<span class="line">be the ripple? Be the ripple? The ripple? Ripple.<br /></span>
<span class="line">Hmmm. I see what you did there.</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">Silence. What happened then. I felt it. But it won’t<br /></span>
<span class="line">satisfy me to think it. I already know it. I know it<br /></span>
<span class="line">already. I’ll try. It’s happening. I don’t know it at all.</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">A disappearing pebble. Say they all are in the end.<br /></span>
<span class="line"> ever rippling ripple? No, if anything ever was<br /></span>
<span class="line">it was still the pond. The still pond. A ripple of feeling</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">making a little music at the edge, a lapping tongue<br /></span>
<span class="line">at the beach of no one, big lovely solid cup clay world.<br /></span>
<span class="line">She must be that thing they mean by Objective Reality.</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">But there is nothing subjective about the pond.<br /></span>
<span class="line">We really do ripple, not just or even just not with pebbles<br /></span>
<span class="line">but with frogs, raindrops, the ticklish feet of upside down</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">Row-yer-boatie boatmen. We’re all alive and ripply ripply.<br /></span>
<span class="line">I’m a happy pond. Plenty going on. I must have come from rain<br /></span>
<span class="line">and to rain I return and by rain I am replenished.</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">And from under. I am a little showing of a deeper level.<br /></span>
<span class="line">An ocean under the land. This whole thing is moist.<br /></span>
<span class="line">Until it seems dry, and I become small and bitter</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">dark like tea. A stainer of paper. Maybe sometimes<br /></span>
<span class="line">I completely disappear. Evaporate. A different me<br /></span>
<span class="line">fills their cup, if it wasn’t mud or reeds or dust,</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">or wasn’t for someone maintaining me, needing me.<br /></span>
<span class="line">You who hear the bunny honking in their sleep maybe.<br /></span>
<span class="line">Maybe you understand me? Umbert? Is that you?</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">Is this silence? This utterly non-subjective pond<br /></span>
<span class="line">whose ripples are only a kind of sound to the right<br /></span>
<span class="line">kind of ear. How do those unappearing pebbles appear?</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">The ones that cause the ripples only no one can hear?<br /></span>
<span class="line">More delicate than duck weed roots, less obviously war-<br /></span>
<span class="line">ping than the light green lentils of the…</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">surface of me? On the place I end that is not the cupped<br /></span>
<span class="line">container of my bottom. Sky source and earth source<br /></span>
<span class="line">and back and forth to so many roots and branches…</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">such a great tangle of sense. Of senses. Does the pond<br /></span>
<span class="line">does the pond think? Not just while rippling, of ripples.<br /></span>
<span class="line">Not just of still, while rippling, of rippling still.</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">The pond is thinking of still while it is still<br /></span>
<span class="line">because when it no longer is, neither still<br /></span>
<span class="line">nor rippling, it cannot think but only cycle,</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">not be becoming but be potential. And but<br /></span>
<span class="line">if that is what it always was. No, I am lost.<br /></span>
<span class="line">The thoughts are all just ripples, but the still</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">is not just still. It is forever. All ways.<br /></span>
<span class="line">This is the thought that is the pebble<br /></span>
<span class="line">that does not cause a ripple. The word</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">has an origin but no cause, has an end<br /></span>
<span class="line">without effect. Is this the edge? The edge<br /></span>
<span class="line">of the interdependent web, or net…</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">Or neither web nor net. Not if such<br /></span>
<span class="line">is the jewel<br /></span>
<span class="line">of ev’ry nexus, and such</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">is the centre<br /></span>
<span class="line">and the edge<br /></span>
<span class="line">of the web</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">and the silk is just the spider<br /></span>
<span class="line">of the child of the rainbow of the word<br /></span>
<span class="line">unweaving itself and weaving itself.</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">Umbert? No flies on you? No flight<br /></span>
<span class="line">nor fall? No way to be alone but this nor not to be?<br /></span>
<span class="line">This is the why. Umbert. Isn’t it?</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">Isn’t this the why? The why of the way?<br /></span>
<span class="line">The why of the gently? Gently down the stream?<br /></span>
<span class="line">There is no reason and yet this is its origin.</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">The light in which it makes perfect sense.<br /></span>
<span class="line">The non-light of which there is no nonsense.<br /></span>
<span class="line">Excepting that which is literally poetry, of course,</span></p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="line">Row-yer-boatie.<br /></span>
<span class="line">Heheheh.<br /></span>
<span class="line">Umbert.</span></p>

<h2>14:52</h2>

<p>Ok guys, so I’m gonna do a kind of nursery rhyme one.</p>
<p>Ooh I likes nursery rhymes.</p>
<p>E sed kindov Mand it’s not gonna be an actual one.</p>
<p>Aye I bloody bet it’s not. Won’t be suitable fur children knowin im.
Probably mention is bum or is willy or summit.</p>
<p>Well, my jenny an joe are always doin that too Mand.</p>
<p>Yeah burt e’s an old man isn’t it? Snot right.</p>
<p>E’s not that old Mand!</p>
<p>E’s not young is e Lezzer? So e’s old then int e? Too old to be
torkin about is willy in a nursery rhyme. E’s not right you wait.</p>
<p>Um, it’s sort of based on Row row row yer boat, do you guys know that
one?</p>
<p>There we are see Mand y can’t do anythink dirty wiv that?</p>
<p>But actually, apart from life being a dream and, um, taking things a
bit gently, it’s not got anything to do with that.</p>
<p>But that IS it? Intit samdumb? Thas all it’s about?</p>
<p>Um, yeah I s’pose so Brian but you can go a few places from there,
and so, well I s’pose this one, well I dunno really.</p>
<p>You better get on with it then, it can’t be that different.</p>
<p>No, it is really, it really is quite different. I mean, this isn’t
even that in a way, just a kind of weird silly echo of it.</p>
<p>But it has to be it, really, doesn’t it? Or you wouldn’t be sayin all
this? Songs are always the same otherwise the whole thing’s nonsense! I
put on The Floyd I want to hear The Floyd comin out! I put on track 3 I
want to hear track 3! Same thing, same bloody song, it has to be!</p>
<p>Erm, it doesn’t actually Brian. What about when you saw em play
live?</p>
<p>Thas what I’m sayin Norm. If they didn’t play Wish I was there then
I’d’ve gone mental wouldn’t I? It has to be the same song or else
nothing makes sense and I’m not buyin nothin.</p>
<p>But it was a little bit different wasn’t it Brian, from the
record?</p>
<p>It was the same bloody song Norm the same bloody song.</p>
<p>OK guys, well, this is just a sort of weird experiment really. When I
did it in my bedroom just then it lasted like 15 minutes. No nursery
rhyme lasts that long. It’s about a pond anyway, not a little boat on a
river. I shouldn’t’ve said anything. You guys just get on with your
drinks and, um, I’ll get the next round in, after this.</p>

<hr />

<p>So, what did you reckon about that? Guys?</p>
<p>I prefer the original I think Sam.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it didn’t really work as a nursery rhyme love, there
was far too many words and they dint even rhyme. I think yer better off
stickin to that plant waterin stuff.</p>
<p>What’s that Lezzer? Plant waterin stuff?</p>
<p>She means yer birdy birdy tinkle tonk music wiv yer piano fing.</p>
<p>Oh, right, my organic syncronisitish glissandi? When I stroke the
spacetimeaning interface and make everything go wibbly?</p>
<p>Aye thas right the noodle box thingy, wiv the birdies, I likes that.
My plants like it too.</p>
<p>I think I’m gonna have a pancake and then a little lie down guys,
thanks for the feedback I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>You keep it up Samdumb it adds a little bit of colour to the
place.</p>
<p>Yeah it’s weird but it doesn’t matter really because looking out the
window is better than telly.</p>
<p>Aye.</p>
