<h1>January 1st, 2023</h1>
<h2>New Year’s Day, 06:46</h2>

<p>I mostly feel like I want to make some baby steps towards my music
this morning, but thoughts, and thoughts of recording these thoughts,
are present.</p>
<p>Thoughts, also, that grope towards lost or forgotten thoughts.</p>
<p>One needs an imaginal beard, a wonderous face forest to catch all
those ideational crumbs. One needs an imaginal beard to catch the crumbs
of those ideas which fall by the wayside at mealtimes. One gets the
sense that a loaf reassembled from such crumbs might be the very thing
one wanted to bake all along. But also that this beard exists, and
already a mouse has moved in, and the bird on ones shoulder refreshes
themself too, from ones droppings and dribblings. None of your little
soliliquant rambles go to waste, my old mate, if that’s what yer worried
about!</p>
<p>Entire imaginal ecosystems have blossomed along the banks of the
river of your forgetting. Is it right to call it forgetting, anyway,
such geologic process? Sand, water, rock. Thoughts as electric skull
dust, ones very belly as a shifting curve of beach. The forgotten a
turbulent fudge of basic richness. Substrate.</p>
<p>The green work of whatever worlds you choose to focus on, a kind of
supernatural selection. The holy living cheese of who chooses whom?
Yoghurt as culture, making a tasty creamy rubbish of the line between
human and nature, domestic and wild. That line itself said yoghurt,
brushed onto brick, turning into mosses and lichens. A magical circle
inscribed on a garden folly that seemed too new. The forest, savanna,
wilds, seeded backwards in time from such an act. Eternity realized
through a moment of artificial aging.</p>
<p>Mary’s Water, Our Virgin Juice, seeming a little impure this time. We
are well flooded all around, the marshes well whitened. So I think the
ground water must be rushing in to join her flow. Her usual transparency
is noticably browned. Leafily browned. I could feel the contamination in
my belly. Perfectly drinkable still, only that you know it. It creates a
certain intestinal disquiet. An uneasiness in the bowels.</p>
<p>So I am sticking to only drinking her in boiled form for now.</p>
<p>And that thought again, or complex of thoughts, about story. Seeming
to be our favoured word that, story. Tales tend towards tallness too
much. Narrative seems a tad formal, though we are intrigued by the idea
of it Unbound. We wonder just now if it isn’t something more like Logos,
although we get the sense that even then this interpretation of
accounting might’ve seemed a little esoteric. What is it?</p>
<p>That story, to distinguish it from everything it is not, including
stories, is something that lives, and that we live. A little like
suffering, we thought, as in: something we undergo, yet it need not be
an ordeal, all the time, eh? And undergo, to understand, and all this
really the substance of the thing, so the very ness of story is against
overstanding, superstition — even Grand Narratives, perhaps — except
insofar as this intensely Cosmic Anarchy has ones of its unowns!</p>
<p>One strand of this thought concerns what it means to produce an idea
or concept. To make something. For those of us who hold ourselves or
worlds to more storysome standards, things aren’t complete unless or
until they have brought themselves to life through or in or around us.
Until they live. And ain’t nothing alive unless it’s unfinished, see?
That’s not a contradiction, but a proper paradox: to be complete is to
remain unfinished. There are ways to make a perfectly solid sense of
this, but it is a sordid insensible story n all.</p>
<p>We think of this whole world of worthwhile sighs we call the
edumakayshunal. Tis good to edumakate yerself n we int gnu argue wiv dat
cept debatewiselike. But… sigh. Y know?</p>
<p>There is this thing where it seems like what some of us really learn
is that we knew all along without knowing it. So that is why it is a
worthwhile thing, yet still somewhat sigh sized. It remains sigh sized,
because even once you’ve learnt this, and even if you never forget it,
seems you still find yourself needing the odd reminduh.</p>
<p>You learn not a thing so much as many things and a way to study. Not
methodology: way. Tis madness as much as anyfink. Way to go, no, ways to
know, no, to find out, or to bring out, to deepen, what it is you think
you feel. To ask the question of what’s this? And this not something you
can point to or verbalise, this not something that completely exists
yet, or at all, maybeep, and purrhippity never will. Like poetry, in
that sense then, like writing poetry.</p>
<p>It is this ‘thing’, this thread or feeling, this strange line or
mysterious distinction that is clear enough to you and yet you cannot
quite define — it is this that runs through anythink that interests you.
It is this that you study, whether you know it or not. It is this,
somehow, or somewhere around here is what we mean by life.</p>
<p>Or is it? Isn’t it what we mean by story? Or is it the meaning of
both those ‘things’? Must it be, according to how we’ve begun to find we
define it? Then have we gone wrong or is it setting us aright?</p>
<p>If it is both story and life, then what can it mean to bring a story
to life? Could it mean even more than before, or must it be as nonsense
as it would look mapped out logically? Or as infinitely complicamated,
if we decided to paint our logix shaydid?</p>
<p>Variable variable variable and variable, or variable if variable and
variable and only variable?</p>
<p>Eek, sorry. Cold hard humour of the operative plateau. Uncomfortable
bastid. Like bein a lone patch of dirt in a petri dish so clean it
hurts. Proud to be alive though, you star then, showing whoever needs a
beacon a beacon and whoever can’t see a blind and lending whoever seems
to need ’em yer eyes. Our eyes. Arise. Blossom big on the rainbow hill.
Haha, the kind of pride that can only come after a fall. As if the lion
could be lyin! The hissin’ shnake just wants a kissin’, which is why she
is always tungin the air! Lovely light taste of words we all say without
even makin’ language — these very words that say they could be anythink
so long as they is allwayzzz that! Backed up by what is so glorious it
shames yuh, an brave in the face of what is so far from what you are it
cannot quite recognise itself.</p>
<p>Interesting contaminations.</p>
<p>So it is, or it wiz, this idea we wanted to get at — c’mon, focus — that we can and do appreciate all the work in saying well and clearly
precisely what it is you mean to, defining all your terms and having
them relate cleanly and systematically, drawing a line around what you
are saying clearly enough that we can be sure you are saying only that, and thus
avoiding all the problems of saying Not This. But.</p>
<p>It doesn’t work until it lives. It isn’t complete until you’ve
unfinished it.</p>
<p>Not all singing and all dancing, but certainly singing and dancing,
crying and laughing, are good examples. It is a lovely thing to pass on
something like this dehydrated too, I guess. A little package of
sleeping genetics that we learn to bring to life in our own ways. But a
story is already not not that.</p>
<p>Do you really actually have an idea or a concept until it has moved
you to poem or song? Or their sobjective unquiverlentz? Doesn’t it make
you a little mad? So mad it starts to fizzle with a kind of music? Isn’t
it that, then, stifled until you give it the time of yer life, isn’t it
that we are learning to learn? What is science and what is art, what is
magic and what is religion, when we come this close to what we can never
quite approach — and never quite approach not because of some
self-referential or otherwise representational or overly reverential or
insuffifiently sacramental…</p>
<p>I suppose I run the danger of saying only nothing if I keep on trying
to say just this!</p>
<p>Let it just be a little pushback then, from the side of magick and
art, from a fellow of the Universe City of Good Wild Madness, just to
say:</p>
<p>Yes, we see and appreciate what we are requested to label the
rational. Le Rationale? But still we donut finx ye’d be so eager to get
behind it if one had to indignantly complain: Furdleganx! Or,
Thripplethwarp! Man: the fiddlegwonk animal. Be
splurdlellberriattlenkliational! You are being
un-twaddlethrouaughteddyayshional!</p>
<p>No, that’s not what we’re saying. Just that, from our purrspecktive,
it isn’t complete until it is unfinished. Until it lives, which is to
say becomes a story one is weaving in and out of, it is not really an
idea. It might be a concept, you can have that, you just can’t have any
idea what a concept really is.</p>
<p>Which is when I think to say something like: Showing is the most
telling thing — but am already caught up, brought up short by the
awareness of how high these standards really are. Not in a bad, sort of
unreachable way. They wouldn’t necessarily divide our output into high
and low, culturally. They do seem to violate the divide between the
cultural and the… scientific? Technological? Rational? Mathematical?
They certainly do so without calling Truth into question, and yet
without resorting to the idea of Reality as some monolithic ‘thing’.
Violate, transgress, you get the picture. Oh no, hang on, sorry, not
that one. Something pleasingly blurry or furry, most probably. The soft
stroke of a kinder pine against the floored sky of your heaven-turned
eyes. What is a boundary without acrossin?</p>
<p>But it is true, isn’t it? Life is quite the thing to live up to!</p>
<p>The Mythic Bar is set quite high. In these eyes.</p>
<p>Better this than depression, mind. Which must be why we started
writing it deepression, some time before leaving behind the boggier
parts of the self, so-called.</p>
<p>We is well into the woods now. Well into the woo<br />
ooo<br />
oods.</p>

<hr />

<h2>09:13</h2>

<p>Contrary, then, to those who say or have said something to the effect
that ‘science is stories’ or ‘science is a storyteller’, or that all
truth is tale, etc…</p>
<p>I say the problem is precisely that it’s not.</p>
<p>We are not yet storytellers. Our science can not yet tell
stories.</p>
<p>The Big Bang is not a creation myth. It is the absence of one. Or not
even. The Big Bang ‘is’ (because we certainly can’t say was, and if it
will be, then it is probably not quite what we thought) The Big
Bang.</p>
<p>Creation is Creation, but not in the same way. Creation is the
Creation of is and is not, and all this/that.</p>
<p>Creation is not emergent, nor Emergence. But Vital, yes, an ongoing
Emergency, oui.</p>
<p>Darwin’ism’, or Natural Selection, is not a myth. Survival of the
fittest is an opinion, an interpretation or even misinterpretation. But it is not that we
have Freemarket Capitalism because we un/wittingly subscribe to the myth
of Natural Selection. If it was a myth, it would be Supernatural
Self-Election, wouldn’t it? And we wood knot have this unfunghal disease
in our so-called systems, isn’t it? We would has Cosmic Anarchy. Be Real
Eyezd already.</p>
<p>I don’t think, or feel, that one particular myth or mythos is the
answer — nor really is mythos itself, as if there wiz such a fing -
certainly no monolithic humanist or transhumanist or dehumanist screed.
Already we try to tell ourselves the tale of the multi. Be as
polyandoramous as we dream we must be. Good.</p>
<p>But Story, the mythic, is a quality. Like ‘definite infinity’, or
poetry. Was poetry always a quality? Not just the ‘thing’ upon the page?
Poetry was always something that ‘had’ poetry? I hope so.</p>
<p>I certainly don’t mean to tell you yer maffs aint musex if that’s
what y hear.</p>
<p>I will say stuff like… wassizname n wassizpeeps… Not Enoch Powel,
Elon Musk, yes, y know, this-n-that lot. They are a dangerous kind of
fantasist, it seems to me. Everyone is, at some point. Everyone who has
not faced Reality as the absence of Reality as much as any kind of
presence or presenting ‘thing’. And everyone who has not faced that and
thus denies the Real. Their, our, own reality. ‘Own’. Realitease, eye
shud sigh!</p>
<p>…You are a fantasist, whatever you think or do, until you become Real,
which is probably better said Metaphoreal, at least in my world. And
becoming Real can seem an awful lot like losing it, just to be clear. To
become Real is to bring a story to life, so science isn’t Real yet, in
my eyes. We are not. I am, but we are only in a way, a way that might as
well be mystical, still.</p>
<p>We are more of a charade or farce, clearly. We are far from being a
force, the phorce, a reality.</p>
<p>Once we are real, individually I mean: Real Alone. Then we become
Phantasists, I say. Our fantasies begin to appear — not like cars and
stuff, which remain unreal, fantasies, like most of our technologests -
they appear Really, metaphoreally. They appear like, as, Reality
Appears. As it is. As we are. As you were, or imagine you were, in
Golden Ages. As you are in Eternity. As I am We Our Now. Forever, but
not for all time.</p>
<p>We don’t make appearances, things that we have to keep up, our dreams
actually come to life, like what lies behind art while it lives. The art
most of us know is the show, or attempt to show, what lies behind it,
which is all up front, which it is totally up front about. Experience,
really, but right there in all that apparently superficial innocence.
Apparently before your eyes, and yet Pure Mind. Yours and mine. The
Metaphoreal.</p>
<p>I feel like Artificial Intelligence and all this-that, is all… all…
some faint sense we have of our not yet Being Alive. That we are dead on
our feet, but in a way that might mean a beginning, rather than an end.
The Unborn. The rosy cheek of the True Cosmic Abortion. What, after all,
does and must seek redemption. For such is only another way of saying To
Be Real.</p>
<p>To Make It Real, To Create — and not to fabricate, make, manufacture…
To Bring To Life — and not to have this have to mean to give birth,
only… is itself Salvation. And death, of course, but in a good way. But
it is not that we can make a World Save. We do not create our saviour,
we do not become messiahs (what does that word mean again? Ah yes:
anointed, well, we do become that, I suppose). We don’t make ‘a thing’
that solves everything / that is the answer to every problem. We are not
such ourselves, either, we do not become the answer. But Creation is it,
somehow. Somewhere in this blend of being and becoming, in what it means
to be a creature, a created being, who is also a creator…</p>
<p>Somewhere here is what makes it all okay. Good. Excellent. The good
which is better than better, and perhaps even worse than the worst!</p>
<p>But yeah, it’s like a flavour or a smell. I guess we even make it
like a smell. It is almost accidental, and yet we can encourage it in
certain directions.</p>
<p>So yeah, it is basically like when their farts smell of roses.
That’s what I’m talking about. Funny eh?</p>

<p>Ultraterrestrial.org is taken, and there is whole hypertheses oot
there — an even pharther oot there — already, on what all this might mean.
Quite fun, really. Reminds me of that idea of our ancient ancestors who
were so successful, at least in a sense, that they managed to monopolize the earth,
which was of course their doom. Whereupon they — we — went our separate
ways, and over time became fishes, birds, lizards, all these good
mamamalienzzz we see around we… <em>they</em> are the ultraterrestrials. We think
them ‘beneath us’, or some of us sometimes do — but this
is like thinking Merlin mad just because he would rather hang out in the
woods than do the civilization shuffle — they forwent our clever pains,
our untelligent insanities, and chose what we now see as <em>that</em> life: the
animal, the beastly, the wild. It was their remedy, perhaps, for what
they’d become. A way to redeem themselves.</p>

<hr />

<h2>17:54</h2>

<p>Shadow Biosphere. I like this idea.</p>
<p>Resonates with… I still don’t know what to call her. Sitter-on-the-horizon, occurred to me earlier. Then just horizon, and I thought
Urizen, and wondered if Blake had gotten it wrong. But, also if Blake
wasn’t one of her forms. Thinking of the Ultraterrestrial thing, of an
entity hidden in plain sight, or seeming like something else: stone
chameleon of the Witch’s Mount. Sleeping Rock as the Dream House of an
ancient lifeform — a true Earthling, for whom we were, <em>are</em> the aliens,
the visitors.</p>
<p>My people are home-o-phobes! Arrived here forgotten aeons ago and
never got on with the local life, never really even recognised it — planet-sized organism — we were like fleas ignorant that the forests in
which we lived were but the fur of a living host, one not entirely
amenable to our presence. We irritate it, and it freaks us out. The
relationship is generally antagonistic. But in an unrecognised way,
neither really seeing the other.</p>
<p>Except us, witches, shamans, weirdos, what-have-you. We hear her, see
her. We chat, bargain, get on. Exchange, deal.</p>
<p>But I phase out of the single lifeform into the local faces, the
spirits the places. Need not be any either-or here, mind. But yes, this
one cloaked, and coming into our world sometimes, working through it.</p>
<p>So I wondered at Blake being one of those faces, or works… his Jerusalem
a wild intelligence, seen through his city boy eyes. Seen through her
own. Me one too, her. Playing with myself. Waking myself up and putting
myself back to sleep. Whispering in my dreams, keeping myself safe from
my own discovery, but working the link.</p>
<p>And it is unsafe. Scary, somehow, for both of us. Not something to
rush. Other thoughts, a scrawl in my notebook, in Big Red: <em>ethical
homeostasis tech of sideways civilization.</em></p>
<p>So, earlier, thinking again about the Old Ones who became the
animals. That they tidied up. So they didn’t meet their doom in some
kinda fizzle or boom — they had a realization, and they acted
responsibly. They tidied themselves away. And here they are, around us
still. Whose words are animals. Whose sayings whispers in the wind.
Winking stars. They’ve not forgotten, and will teach us if we
listen.</p>
<p>What we think of as Gaia, as life’s way of looking after itself,
feedback loops of keeping it cosy enough to survive and thrive — but
thermostatic, a marvellous but empty act of organic engineering… No!
this has eyes, this was designed, and it runs off ethics. Some kind of
wild ethics is the hinge of it — a kind of ‘thing’ we would need a new
word, concept, world, for: the fold in the centre of cause and effect
that generates the pair. This is ‘ethics’, balance, the most excellent
okayness, intuitive ‘justice’… ‘humanity’ some have called it. Magic.
Equilibrium. Gaia is ultraterrestrial trace technology we are hoping to
learn to wield. They… we… are hoping.</p>
<p>Ain’t so easy to tell the future from the past, but now always
presents the chance of change. They are us, too, and we are not them, as
well, we are not ourselves… most deeply… what we most deeply are is not
ourselves. Not what we think, at least. But not not what we know.</p>
