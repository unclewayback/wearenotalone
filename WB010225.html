<h1>26th February</h1>
<h2>08:56</h2>

<p class="stanza">
<span class="line">The cloud is so low the morning seems a shadow<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">but there is nothing for it to be a shadow of<br /></span>
<span class="line">Inside this room the objects still cast shadows<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">inside this room the shadow gets thicker still<br /></span>
<span class="line">But the creatures cast no shadows, perhaps the birds<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">move too quick, but the rabbit doesn&#39;t<br /></span>
<span class="line">I am stiller still, sat at my desk, but I look over my shoulder<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">and can see no shadow, no shadow of my own<br /></span>
<span class="line">My hand reaching for the mug casts a quick shadow<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">but it could&#39;ve been a bird going past the window<br /></span>
<span class="line">In the field out the window in front a seed like a little spark<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">catches and a golden tree springs up<br /></span>
<span class="line">It was just for a moment but the invitation is for all time.</span></p>

<p class="stanza">
<span class="line">The very door is marked wrong, like an answer on a test,<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">but the red pen happened so often the ink became<br /></span>
<span class="line">Invisible, even though it was and is not. The wrongs are quite<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">obvious, quite low level, simple discrepancies<br /></span>
<span class="line">More or less, still it must be a kind of cleverness<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">to walk on past, unless it is merely foolishness<br /></span>
<span class="line">To enter. To enter the door marked wrong. I see now<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">this was the invitation, an invitation to look again,<br /></span>
<span class="line">For the one who was wrong to return, unable to block out<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">the nagging update, my mistake was imagining<br /></span>
<span class="line">I had to get something right instead of just imagining<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">instead of just realizing the door marked wrong<br /></span>
<span class="line">It was right for me, it was always open just like I will be.</span></p>

<p class="stanza">
<span class="line">I am entrancing me, somewhere between the wing of a bird<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">and the incidental waving of my hand<br /></span>
<span class="line">Is an error where it does not matter what error it was<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">only to see its correction is not the only only<br /></span>
<span class="line">The shadow of the bird is a certain understanding of it<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">the shadow of my hand is a schematic<br /></span>
<span class="line">Even a picture of a hand holding a pencil drawing<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">a hand holding a pencil is a plan I do not need<br /></span>
<span class="line">But I will have to go outside to greet the tree that grows<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">the tree that grows in the gap of me<br /></span>
<span class="line">In the gap between me and whatever we imagine<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">is meant to be. That really is<br /></span>
<span class="line">Outside, where the sunlight dancing on water comes from.</span></p>

<p class="stanza">
<span class="line">Appears slowly but definitely like the first note of dawn<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">struck by a certain blackbird<br /></span>
<span class="line">In an appropriately opening way, a sliding in, say,<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">but just because lively chaos comes fizzing in<br /></span>
<span class="line">Through a gap in the clouds that could be the future now<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">doesn&#39;t mean the creatures will cast shadows.<br /></span>
<span class="line">A tree that lived for a flash of one fool&#39;s mind in the actual<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">Earth, suggesting something never new but ready to<br /></span>
<span class="line">Always ready to be freshly told: every tent needs a pole<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">but not every jacket needs to be a potato<br /></span>
<span class="line">If you want to know how many you are number my branches<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">in the time of my twigs between horse&#39;s teeth<br /></span>
<span class="line">The scent of the gorse flower is your answer.</span></p>

<p class="stanza">
<span class="line">It is not a silly one. Smell it and remind yourself of those<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">desert island memories. Her perfume blooms<br /></span>
<span class="line">and fades, comes and goes throughout all of the constancy<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">your love is, your attention, my gift â€”<br /></span>
<span class="line">It was a great question. It is a great question. It will be<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">a great question you can only really answer<br /></span>
<span class="line">Wrong. Keep on. Keep coming through this door of slid<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">together perceptions, wherein a bird pecked<br /></span>
<span class="line">The cheek of a seed that echoed cutely in a rabbit&#39;s belly<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">and planted a kiss on your head like a skull<br /></span>
<span class="line">On a butterfly&#39;s back that became a flash of gold<br /></span>
    <span class="indented-line">and gemstone leaves in a drowsy field<br /></span>
<span class="line">Where a rare light shone in truth and cast no shadow.</span></p>

<p><span class="indented-line">*</span></p>
<p>(In Light Of What Should Happen?)</p>
