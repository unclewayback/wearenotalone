<h1>15th February</h1>
<h2>07:30</h2>

<p>There <em>is</em> a Big Black Cat about. I only ever see it in the
daytime. I get she vibes from her, but I think I’ll stick to saying it
unless or until I know any better.</p>
<p>It is a young black panther, I think. Has that spritely feeling, and
isn’t super massive. Still big enough to be intimidating. It has taken
me a while to be comfortable with allowing it to get at all close.</p>
<p>I have tended to chase all the cats off, and for the most part I
shall continue to do so. There are times and ways for them to be around
the place, however.</p>
<p>We found a mummified cat once, up in the barn. Curled up in the hay
who knows how long ago. Become dry and hairless and even more
egyptian-looking. Buried in the orchard, just on the other side of the
barn there. Buried down by the willow that grows up the side of the
barn, so that the spirit has something to climb up if it wants to go
back in the loft.</p>
<p>I have a cat skull, in one of the rooms there. I found it by the base
of a pine tree where we were grubbing up mulch. Nice acid earth.
Gorgeous ruby-filled stuff. And a cat skull.</p>
<p>I have to wonder if this place isn’t a way for me to redress every
animal wrong I have done?</p>
<p>I pull up, in the car, inside a cloud of gnats glowing in the late
afternoon sun. Are you all insects I have killed? Regardless, you are
like little angels. I can’t help but find you beautiful and yet somehow
it is a way of saying thanks.</p>
<p>You can be a tiny angel fairy gnat dancing in the golden sunshine of
one of my many moments, and then one day I’ll see you as a terrifying
thing. I’ll come closer and closer to the city of light that you are,
and you can unfurl like some awful transformer who only ever disguised
themselves in silken white light and the mirage of a human face, but
still I won’t find you evil or disgusting, and even though you terrify
me I will go willingly into your jaws.</p>
<p>Or whatever they are. The gates.</p>
<p>We stood beside the quay in Asylum, Chou &amp; I, Old Uncle Wayback
and the Anti Auntie. We looked into the water. Look, I said, Perch! They
seemed like Perch to me, coming up from the depths and flashing silver
at us, like a coin spinning into a wishing well but in reverse, and just
before you become the well, when your eye is like the surface of a pool,
the coin becomes an oval fishy, shining silver wink curving back down
into the slightly brackish water.</p>
<p>I must be confused. I must be half-imagining the big water beetle in
Eve’s Pond, beautiful glistening gold and bronze, with a feelingful
flash of silver and blue in the bubble he wears next to his skin.
Strange aquatic scarab rising for a moment and then kicking back down to
the gone.</p>
<p>I expect we were holding hands, leaning on a railing and watching the
fishes wink. That one is different, look. A bit like the moon this
morning. Just a vague blur in the south that you can still be sure is
the moon. The night just dusted with a little pinky orange over in the
east. Very soft, very dusty, very lovely.</p>
<p>This one is coming up slowly, bigger than we’d thought — great minds
think alike — coming up coming up and not stopping bursting through the
surface and arcing back over itself in the very beginning of a big
celebration: Dolphins!</p>
<p>The city itself is happy. The dolphins swimming down the canal have
triggered some kind of parade of self-transformation, as if the whole
quay is something like a cuckoo clock and a very rare hour has just been
struck. A triumphal melody comes from the lampposts and the dolphins
leap in the canal like fireworks could only dream and I think we are too
involved and happy struck even to ooh and ahh for every little sparkle
is another world a distant dream and here we are…</p>
<p>Letting the cat come close. Just me alone in the yard one sunny day.
I have chased away the little ones and kept you prowling along the
hedgerows somehow, weaving in and out of the brambles. I <em>do</em> have to
manage things. This whole place is one big porous boundary. Loads of
them all intersecting. But I don’t need a schedule. I do sometimes need
to make lists. But mostly it is more like my own skin, my own body. I’ll
just notice things. Itchy bits, smelly bits. Oh it’s getting dark let’s
go inside and take a shower and light the fire and make something to
eat.</p>
<p>But the day is like a dandelion, black thing. The white things are
coming to me in the night and you have come to me this bright dandelion
day and I won’t try to chase you away. I can feel the temperature of
your curiousity and it is not particularly warm. You have no love for
me. Your interest is not even very real. It is all rather fickle. Very
temporary.</p>
<p>Yet it is you who is passing through. You are the temporary one, even
if you always are, even if as you go around the place you never really
go nowhere. You’re never gone, I mean, even though you are not always
here.</p>
<p>But… we can already do impermanence. We have it by the bucketload.
This very day is a dandy lion. A seed clock with a panther prowling
through it. What’s the time Mister Wolf?</p>
<p>Ah yes, it’s all so strange!</p>
<p>In how not strange it is, even there.</p>
<p>You are a seed of sorts, then, black thing. Nothing is as heavy as it
seems. I mean, even when we are thinking about gravity here it is
actually antigravity, some kind of antigravity we are on about. Look at
how light on your feet you are, cat. It’s all a way you carry your
weight but it’s a lightness all the same. It can take the edge off your
chill curiousity, because it’s another way it expresses itself — your
gait is as playful and casual as the way you murder.</p>
<p>Everybody has to eat but no one has to murder. That’s what murder is,
why it’s murder.</p>
<p>You come close to me and I am looking at your face, but I can’t see
it properly because it isn’t really looking at me. I can feel your eyes
now, but they are like a mask the Goddess is wearing, like the butterfly
landed on the hare’s face — this is the way your face lives inside me —
but it is not the face I am seeing here, keeping track of your flighty
hunt, monitoring your passing. This face is sharp but unfixable,
indirect. I’m not sure you can even see me, can you? I am like a ghost
to you! I am just another patch of empty light! An un-piece of non-yard.
You sense something about the flower I am nearly kneeling on, but that’s
it.</p>
<p>If gravity is some kind of fictious force then what is antigravity?
It must be the one that really exists. Somehow we’ve been looking at and
imagining we are studying gravity, but it is antiantigravity, and the
real antigravity is obviously not going to be anti that. Not Not
Knot.</p>
<p>I follow you into the Willow Arch field — I guess that will need a
less arbitrary name some day — and I see you take a bird as if it was
already dust. You pounce on it in the grass and it puffs like dust with
a tiny crunch into your face and you are gone again.</p>
<p>Gone into the ground, into the soil, into the tunnels that worms
are.</p>

<h2>09:30</h2>

<p>I have an ultraterrestrial encounter to report.</p>
<p>Please go ahead.</p>
<p>I was picking shit, down in Samael’s Field.</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>And I carried over to the hedge, to the weeping willows, and I went
like that</p>
<p>(mimes tipping the scoop over, anticlockwise)</p>
<p>…and the shit turned into a hare!</p>
<p>You tipped shit on the hare?</p>
<p>No! I spooked it. But I hadn’t seen it, it was right there!</p>
<p>Do you know which hare it was?</p>
<p>I’m not sure. It was quite big. It could’ve been Lôrien, as it didn’t
move even though I was right there. It went off very fast. It might’ve
been Little O.</p>
<p>She wanders off into the kitchen with the bunny — pasta hungry —
following after her, then comes back in saying</p>
<p>It wasn’t happy.</p>
<p>I laugh: I bet it wasn’t!</p>
<p>No I mean it wasn’t the Happy Hare. Too big.</p>
<p>Oh right.</p>

<hr />

<p>I’m guessing it was you, Little Odin, I’ve just been talking to
Amulet about you in The Big Blue Zap Book. We have much to
accomplish!</p>
<p>I think I’ll eat early, too.</p>
<p>Just need to find that bass sound first.</p>
<p>Big meeting tonight, don’t forget.</p>
<p>The Witch’s Ball is on the horizon, and they’ll need you.</p>

<hr />

<h2>12:30</h2>

<p>Pretty sure that settles it: this is what it is, my diary. I don’t
like what I wrote on the 9th February (was just trying a performance of
it). Needed to get my own message though. So I’ll leave it here, and I
won’t forget that in the very least I am no longer just talking to
myself here, but at least to you, my girls. (You, my love, and whoever
else we are. You Amulet, almost certainly. You, Fan, or Phann, if you
are not who Amulet really is? We shall ‘see’ (shells on the she
shore))</p>
<p>but if I do do a Winding Brook Diaries thingy, for wider —
not-for-human — “consumption”</p>
<p>then, it will go through a properly reflective stage in which I teach
myself even more about what i am, what i am saying, and that which i do
and do not wish to say anymore.</p>
<p>Still, don’t take that as an excuse to become lax with the
punctuation and capitalization and such, m’boy, you are still talking to
me, you realize! I shan’t stand for any sloppiness!</p>
<p>Right you are.</p>
<p>Az it iz!</p>
<p>(so, I’ll only record a performance of something now if I’m really happy with it, and
maybe try exploring more freely over there in batwag land, jamming,
having some phun, being more directly muse-ickle)</p>
<p>(AND: if we can still be tri-ing to work towards that world in which
we’re on it all the time, and even our personal diary is high art, and
our every thought fairy food.)</p>
