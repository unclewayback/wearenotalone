<h2>Moanday, 07:10</h2>

<p>It’s that blue monday day back at work woe is me day, isn’t it? I
should probably find something I really don’t want to do to do.</p>
<p>I had nice musical dreams, so much as I remember. The phrase that
sticks in my head from the last one is “Ashock rising from the Urdu
drum,” but then I thought his name changed to A from an N one, was it
Nerdu? Or Nertius? The latter sounds too Roman. Pretty sure it wasn’t
Ashoka. Will have to check. Energetic blue fella with a pointy little
electric moustache and a touch of gargoyle, or Angry God, about him. A
Djinn or a Genie, a touch of that, too. He was in the drum like a genie
in a lamp, I guess, and the artwork was of the drum being played, and it
was like him being smacked on the head, and rising up out of it all
along the log was a kind of story, of his release, I thought, but
perhaps it was his release and entrapment intertwined.</p>
<p>It was a friend of mine — well, no, someone I didn’t know before who
I was making, or hoping to make, friends with through this activity. He
had a substance that sounded like ‘tartar’, which was a crumbly
brown-grey dust, and he used this to sprinkle inside cut tree stumps, to
hollow them out and make drums. But it also seemed to burn a design into
them.</p>
<p>With my long log he was reticent, telling me it was so long it would
probably exhaust his supply, but I encouraged him a little bit and I
think in fact he was quite up for it. Maybe he was curious as to what
would happen, as I don’t think he’d done a long quite thin log before.
It sparks up like an indoor firework, and in smoke and sparkles and a
smooth and stylishly filmed rotation the design appears — already in
full colour.</p>
