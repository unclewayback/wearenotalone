<h1>8th February</h1>
<h2>07:00</h2>

<p>I really do have nothing to say this morning. Some semi-musical ideas
though. A visual progression — unfoldment really, of a character. I
mean</p>
<p>it was You I saw</p>
<p>fairy bells in my head, almost captured by pre-echoes of the sweet
little alarm sound that wakes us, slowly ramping up</p>
<p>though normally we are awake already — 06:36 it goes off — was
thinking half six when I set it up but “six thirty six” sounds that bit
the nicer</p>
<p>the fairy bells were almost that — almost my alarm — that is what
kept suggesting itself after them, asking if it was it, but it was just
a sweet little tone, a tiny cymbal ringing out in the noise carpet of
the night</p>
<p>and somehow that was You, who might be Amulet, who feels related to
Fan, and who looks not unlike a Grey in this mode, where you begin with
just two big eyes — round though, not almond-shaped — two big round eyes
in a big round head</p>
<p>and then you become a kind of insect, with antennae a bit like the
horns of that cute little goat at the farm</p>
<p>and then you become a lynx, but highly stylized, in a way I can’t yet
capture: how your features seem to get larger towards the top, from a
small little mouth, to big wide sleepy eyes, to a huge pair of pointed
ears that crown it all — you look cute, but also monumental somehow, and
it’s that bit I can’t quite capture</p>
<p>and then something else, it was, but someone</p>
<p>somewhat</p>
<p>the same, all the same</p>
<p>Sam rolls back the covers, shuffles into his curly-toed slippers, and
flicks on the headlight of his pixie-like sleeping helmet. It is a bit
like a classical wizard’s hat, but floppy. Hmm, could be a dunce’s cap.
It has a little bell of a mysterious blue-silver metal on the end, where
his dreams collect, making sweet music to remind him of the real reality
as he goes about his business in the fields.</p>
<p>Now that he thinks about it, it all reminds him of the real reality.
From the big piles of steaming horse shit, to the gentle twittering
coming from the still bare trees. Now why did I say that thing about
real reality, he wonders.</p>
<p>He is on his hands and knees in Silver Willow Walk, where an Oak —
not just any old oak, (as if there were such a thing, maybe that’s what
he meant, concerning real reality?) — Old Weasel Oak has dropped a
bounty of acorns on the path and the horses would go wild and get sick
on them so he’s grabbing them up into his apron pouch. It is a nice dark
green apron but the pouch is flowery.</p>
<p>I shall make myself a super acorn coffee with these, he thinks, and
consider the question of real reality while I drink it. I should set
myself a time limit though, as these things have been gnome to dragon a
byte.</p>
<p>In order to keep time… well, this is no ordinary kind of time he will
have to keep, he realizes. What use would the sun and the moon beep for
timing the thought leaps of pararandom samdum the ever-whys? No, short
of compounding the gaps of where a thousand starsouls and their
sattelitesoils don’t quite line up, I shall have to construct an ancient
rhyme clock. Such unideal constructs are of course built upon the same
principles as</p>
<p>so they all rolled over and one fell out, or</p>
<p>Yes, I’ll use sitting on the wall mode.</p>
<p>And so there he sits, in the door of the woodshed, looking out into
the yard, meditating on the question of the real reality, which is of
course the whatnot of itself, while seventeen young gentlemen modelled
on the fashions of sparrows sit waiting patiently for something to
happen.</p>
<p>On the old stone wall they are, over by the pond there. Eve’s pond. I
imagine a dragonfly. I imagine I must be remembering it. That’ll be the
fella then, green and yellow wasn’t he? Surprised me a bunch by coming
into the house last year. There is only real reality here.</p>
<p>I need to find something not.</p>
<p>Just then, a sparrow flies down and tries to make love to one of the
little gentlemen. Or are they fighting? Oh yes, I think they must be
fighting. His friend joins in, tries to help him, and before you know it
three of the seventeen are in the pond and a single sparrow feather is
floating across the yard.</p>
<p>Fourteen. Could that be not real? Fourteen? But there are fourteen of
them aren’t there? He counts them quickly, dabbing a far away finger
over their heads and muttering under his breath. Yep. Fourteen is real
too. Numbers must be real.</p>
<p>A young gentleman yawns, takes off his flat cap and waistcoat, and
now his shirt, trousers and shoes, and dives into the pond in his
y-fronts.</p>
<p>What was that we said earlier then, that seemed insightful in the
moment? Actually that’s quite distracting that phrase, that dangly
little particle or whatever it is, how did that get on the end there? In
the moment? What a bloody lot of nonsense.</p>
<p>Sparrowmen numbers three and four appear to have become bored and
have started sparring. Some of the others have gathered around to watch.
A little wrestling match.</p>
<p>I mean, is that moment in this one? Was there some kind of a gap
between them? Has that one stopped I mean, and another one started? If
we were going to go that road we could’ve just used night and
daytime.</p>
<p>One of the wrestlers is very close to the — ah, they’ve both gone
over.</p>
<p>Eleven.</p>
<p>Legs eleven.</p>
<p>Nice long lovely elven legs.</p>
<p>Oh she’s marvellous she is, Our Mary.</p>
<p>She thinks they’re short. Says she’s got a long back. Spent too much
bloody time looking at horses. They’re perfect, I says, you just have to
look at the sweet little peaches of your not-so-secret-seat and see it
all in proportion to them. Centre of my universe they are. That’s my
ruler, my yardstick. Our Mary’s rosy cheekage.</p>
<p>Hang on a min-wheat, there’s only nine sparrow’s left. And one of
them’s an actual sparrow. Eight!</p>
<p>Come on then samdum, get to it. Real reality.</p>
<p>Real reality, he says, slowly this time.</p>
<p>Something’s happening.</p>
<p>Say it even slower.</p>
<p>R e a l R e a l ity</p>
<p>Gor bly mage, that’s right, it’s like the eagle eagle isn’t it?! That
must be why I thought of making a sparrow clock. Would a dandelion have
done it? No! It had to be a set of sparrows! Little bloody pasta gobbies
I love ye! Of course that’s it!</p>
<p>One of the young gentlemen, the fellow who had been sitting quietly a
little away from the others, jumps to his feet, salutes, and back flips
into the pond.</p>
<p>And then there were Seven, as if it mattered.</p>
<p>Reality is a kind of thing, y see? So a <em>kind of</em> thing, too,
and so even a gentle one. My goodness, could that really be the case? Is
reality forgiving?</p>
<p>Three of the young fellows in sparrow clothes have gathered at the
end of the wall, where a gate should be, and are pointing down into the
gaps there and conversating animatedly.</p>
<p>Forget about them just a newt-bat samwise, lay out the spawny essence
of your program before you go leap-frogging off over what for all
intense and porpoises my tent even oddsixt yet.</p>
<p>Easy there fellow, there’s a wobble in the yard pond. Those
sparrowmen are shouting and your thoughts have burbled. Where is
it?!</p>
<p>He stands up and stomps out into the centre. Where are ye, fucker? He
shouts, fist to the sky. Who is throwing invisible stones into our
thought pond? Ye clear the feck off this mannot or oil be farced taggart
me wurzel shpacher!</p>
<p>The problem is the time is not for peas yet, so the shield hasn’t
grown over, y see? This leaves our birdmen vulnerable to skycats, and
there is likely one lurking somewhere hereabouts, maybe perched behind
that suspicious-looking cloud, and the more sensitive among us are upset
by this. I’ll try one more time to direct a thought at it.</p>
<p>It all happens so quick, a buzzard-shaped shadow bursts out the cloud
and heads for the cluster of young gentlemen who are distracted by
something near the end of the wall, Mister Knot whaps out his old smart
phone and speed dials Solone Starlingo by whacky whispering, and before
the breath has finished with his lips the sparrowmen are dangling over
the edge and the shadow is falling upon empty wall. The surface of
things settles again, and the three young gentlemen drop safely to the
floor.</p>
<p>And then there were four.</p>
<p>Sam stares at the house, and gently waggles the end of his dream
helmet to clear the air. Oberon the hare looks back at him from inside
the front room there, from his seat beside the bottom of the spiral
stairs.</p>
<p>The idea is not to get distracted by the spectre of an unreal
reality, then, but to see that the formula is given spontaneously of
itself, as if the non-returnable shit gift of arse elves: dirty as a
fart but clean as a whistle. Say, every melody is a kind of laugh. Here
is a laugh in C Major, there is a giggle in E Minor. But a laugh itself
is just a laugh laugh isn’t it? Of course there are plenty of things and
stuff and shite which is not a laugh. But it could be a kind of laugh. I
mean, what else is a witch’s cackle? One of them deep down
mwaharhars?</p>
<p>That’ll do me, I think, he thinks. Did it with four sparrowmen still
to go. That’s neigh baad. I guess I shall serve them acorn coffee, see
what they make of my discovery before I sends em on their ways.</p>

<h2>18:55</h2>

<p>That lizard earlier, little bronzey brown fellow. He was warming
himself on the side of a plant pot. One of those rectangular containers
of mini square pots. Muddy black plastic, and he couldn’t get enough of
it. He was trying to climb up it, to lay down vertically, absorb all
that tasty precious early spring sun. He kept sort of sliding back down,
but managed it to some degree, got some satisfaction. Love looking at
those funny feet with the long middle toes. Love the sparse sharp
breaths, the soft diamond of the head. I find them kind, they feel kind
to me, just like you would feel if you were happy sunbathing. They have
little lizard smiles and very interesting eyes. It’s been a while since
I had a good look at one’s eyes though. I’m seeing toad’s eyes now.</p>
<p>The king of the hedgerows. Glorious little firecrest. My how I love
that bird! Est-que c’est le Roi? I said. Thought maybe it was wren. Was
flitting around catching small bugs in the air I guess, leaping off
willow branches and just as quickly back to them. I saw the brightness
of its eyestripe. Oui, c’est le Roi. I stood there a while trying to
pronounce it correctly. I can do the airrr a bit better now, but not
when it is near the start there, and followed by a ‘wa’. I just sound
like Jonathan Woss, to me. Chou says I sound cute, and her friend says I
sound charming. They’re biased of course but I’m sure it can’t be all
bad.</p>
<p>I’ve been working along the hedge that runs along the side of the
neighbour’s yard, top of Capability’s Field. Chopped a bunch of the
willows that were leaning in back to a tidier line, to give our new
plantings there some light. Just processing what I sawed down yesterday.
Chopping it smaller and wheeling it off to a corner to stack. Not going
to make the same mistake I did with the hedge beside the drive: letting
it lie there unprocessed for a year. Just end up making myself more
work. I do like working with wood though, even if at the moment it is
mostly just to burn.</p>
<p>Chou came up to me in the yard after I’d finished chopping up a few
old posts for some more firewood — we’re out of the bigger stuff now —
told me, I can’t remember why, probably just the spring sunshine, that I
was her romantic hero, straight out of a McKillip novel, she said. She’s
reading Patricia McKillip again at the moment. If you like fantasy at
all, and you don’t know McKillip, you’re missing out. Start with The
Forgotten Beasts of Eld. Winter Rose and The Changeling Sea are my other
favourites. She’s written a lot and it’s not all that great but some of
it is really perfect. I’m so glad I read those stories. That they exist.
When they reoccurred to me today, it was as rich as anything. They come
back as memories, worlds, lives… meanings like that.</p>
<p>Anyway, Chou told me, as she does sometimes, that I am a perfect
romantic novel hero. I told her quite honestly that she was my heroine,
too, it was just that I couldn’t think of any book she was like a
character in. She’s got shades of those brilliant autistic norwegian
murder detectives, but far too much bunny rabbit. She’s super square in
some ways, and yet totally weird. She’s amazing. I can feel spring
coursing through us both. We are daffodil stems just ready to burst into
flower. Our heads are how the sun feels when it finally hits some
atmosphere and can take a big deep breath. Ah! Clouds! Rain! I fucking
love you Earth, I am totally here, totally against you, totally with
you, this is all of me.</p>
<p>I said I would have to make her the heroine in my own story, because
there’s just no one out there like her. There’s no story I’ve read that
comes close to doing our love justice. It’s all too perfect or too
dramatic, too sanitised or too dirty. We are the pinnacle of weird is
good. So normal it is impossible. The world is insane. I just want to be
your friend. I just can’t not be me. I wish you were here. I’m glad you
are. Thank you for reading. Please say hello some time.</p>
<p>When my hands aren’t all over my wife’s bottom, though, maybe. Mmm,
sorry.</p>
<p>That’s it though. It’s all I want to write about. My God is Goddess.
I’m meant to be saying this tomorrow. I’m hungry. I’m having a wee dram
of Laphroaig. Brought it on the ferry. So good. The fire is lit. I am
freshly showered. I like showering best a bit earlier, not just before
bed — when I get in from the fields. That’s good. It really is next to
godliness, cleanliness.</p>
<p>Yeah, my God is Goddess, and a kind of getting out of the way for
her. Well, he is that space. I want to get out the way a bit. I want to
make sure… I don’t have to. I’m not writing this anyway. I’m following a
thread. I’m a brilliant autistic norwegian bunny detective on a mission
to track down the essence of cuteness as truth. The cuteness of truth.
No, not that. It’s just the basic energy that is important, somehow.</p>
<p>I’m not going to write all that stuff about how I am the Goddess,
now. Do you want to see her in me looking in the mirror? You could. I’m
not a man. I’m not male. I’m not really human. It’s just a bit of me. I
don’t need to change anything to know this. It’s not going anywhere and
it’s coming from everywhere. It’s been so around the block it knows
there isn’t one.</p>
<p>You’ll see this about you, if you hang around a bit, if you don’t see
it already. You’ll catch on how you really need to just give in to the
need to feel the need to want to be taken, in order to really give it.
There is no difference. It is all just there, without imagining, without
doing anything weirder than doing it. It’s beautiful. It’s just being
alive is all. It’s love. It’s the one meaning that life has, that there
is one, a meaning, one meaning. One meaning, and that is what meaning
is, and imagination is all the very many meanings of this. One.</p>
<p>But one meaning. Not one thing. Not even a universe, not a
multiverse. It is the infinite. The meaning is one.</p>
<p>The devil has a beautiful bum. Not a human one. Not an ugly black
scaly one either. Beautiful, dark reddy purplish brown. Smooth but not
unpimpled. Fur above, and fur on the tops of the legs.</p>
<p>I see this stuff sometimes. But I don’t really fantasize. It comes
and goes. I’m totally here. Totally there.</p>
<p>Let me just put a log on the fire.</p>
<p>I can’t think now I don’t really want to think it is everywhere it is
all through my writing scrawled through all my books and all their
margins and strewn through all my pictures and all the sounds that come
through and be around me</p>
<p>but not nearly how it will be, I’m learning all the time. I’ll just
keep sucking it all up and pouring pouring pouring it out just as long
as I can. It’s all for this, all for spring time. I love it all, because
of this, because of these bits, I love it all.</p>
<p>You know she is like that somehow, just like us. You know this is
what perfection is. You’ll get it. Keep on being a perfectionist until
it ruins you and you realize the truth. Keep on being a shoddy bugger
until you can’t take it any more. Just give it the fuck up.</p>
<p>I guess I’ll come back to this.</p>
<p>I don’t want a hot chocolate now, no, you suppose correctly, I need
to eat first.</p>
<p>It’ll come through.</p>
<p>I’ll do little things too.</p>
<p>Humanagable stuff. I like you guys, I do. You guys, not them, not the
ones who don’t read this kind of stuff. Remember to say hello some
time.</p>
<p>And all the rest of it.</p>
