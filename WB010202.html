<h1>2nd February 2023</h1>
<h2>07:42, WB</h2>

<p>Well, maybe I’m writing in descending date order again now. That’s
the way I’d want to read it, so probably for the best. Did it without
thinking, though noticed it felt awkward.</p>
<p>Will probably write the month and year at the top and stop… oh how
very interesting, thank you Samdumb, do go on.</p>
<p>I was feeling the need for recourse to my heart, this morning. Not my
physical heart, but clearly not not, as it is in the same area.</p>
<p>At one point I thought: Angel’s hang from the heart, what we think of
as wings, are their lungs.</p>
<p>I cannot always just empty myself, touch the void that I already am.
This happens. I can always catch wind of it, feel… let it surround,
interpenetrate, make senseless all such sayings in its perfect
imperturbability. Or whatever that word may be.</p>
<p>It is not really not that, this heart thing. It is that I need
somewhere to fix on, to move myself to, to think from, to be.</p>
<p>The thought of the heart is slow and continuous. My head feels
erratic and broken by comparison. Also my head feels the need to act
things out, as in: I will actually catch it typing words sometimes,
things like that.</p>
<p>My migraines are back, you see. I had the second one last night, and I
think it was two nights before that — the gap of a day prior — it first
returned. First migraine since I feel I managed to draw them out while
reading Jung’s Red Book, whenever that was, some years ago now.</p>
<p>Same migraines, although the headaches are not nearly as bad as I
remember. They start from a region that is associated with the lower
middle of my left eye. First time it was very much a square, last night
a little more undecidable. The bottom of it is pulsatory and indefinite,
waves go in and out of it, the top is very sharp and bright. It was very
colourful last night, quite blue and red. There is always plenty white,
and I can see all the colours of the spectrum in it. It interferes with
my vision, being stronger than I what I see ‘out there’ with open
eyes.</p>
<p>This sharp top line, vibrating bright and jagged, is the core of it.
It tends towards my left. I notice it, and when I do so it is smaller
and lower and a little dimmer than it will be. But it is bright enough
to notice, I know that this is the beginning of an ‘attack’. It becomes
more intense, and it also grows in size and begins to move up my visual
field, up and off to the left, where it will eventually disappear.
Before it disappears it will spend a few minutes covering nearly my
entire visual field, making seeing rather difficult. The whole episode
lasts perhaps half an hour. I cannot do anything while it is happening.
Once it is over I am left with a vague headache. I am sure that when
they used to happen before, there was nothing vague about the headache
at all.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it merely highlights a certain disorder, or simply
overactivity, in my mind, or is actually associated with it. I think
they are simply currently coinciding, however I do associate the
migraines with periods of intense thought, and also computer work. I may
have to do less of this.</p>
<p>I feel as if, by Spring Equinox, or the beginning of April, I want to
have said goodbye to my self. It is strange, because I do not want to
stop writing my diary, necessarily. I know there are things I want to
record. This year should see the birth of Notre Flamme, in the most
significant instance. It is more that I want to begin writing somewhere,
someone, something, else.</p>
<p>It is in this sense, I think, mostly, that I want to say good bye to
my self.</p>
<p>No doubt there are others. Ha.</p>
<p>The heart gives me something to hold on to, like the breath, to
return to from the mind’s — although I don’t really like calling it
this… I suppose I could… anyway — interruptions. One does not attempt to
interrupt an interruption, that would be a good example of being trapped
on the same level as that which you seek relief from, very different
from fighting fire with fire.</p>
<p>The thing with the heart is that it is somehow someone. Unlike Mind.
Unlike settling back into the never unsettled, noticing what is never
not there. I don’t know, they work so well together, I am not sure they
can be so different.</p>
<p>But it is different, if I say this. That it is like calling for
something, like inviting someone in. Yes you have to make a space. You
have to make a space for what you are not… not. Clearly this relates to
the constellation of home making feelings. I will seem to be talking
about Christ now, or the King, but she is not different from the Lady,
the Queen of Fairies, who may visit my — our — house, if it is well
looked after. One thing I seem to be doing inside myself, the other
outside, but there is no difference. Except there is, or else what would
I be talking about?</p>
<p>But this is part of the difficulty. This: that I have to invite
something that is better than me, into a place which is not quite ready
for it. An uncomfortable nest. This discomfort is me seeking rest on
some deep level. Approaching something definite and without change,
though not static, not not alive, in order to help me bring about
certain effects, inside and out.</p>
<p>This is the one thought of the heart somehow, and it is also the seat
of song — for me at least, I feel — and there is also a sense in which
it is the trunk of the trunk or the essence of the tree.</p>
<p>You can see how I am not trying to clear my mind, exactly?</p>
<p>But I am hoping to clarify something. Maybe this is all I mean by
confusion practise… all I mean by anything… all I mean.</p>
<p>Surely, from a certain angle, it is folly.</p>
<p>Hence one good reason for avoiding certainty. A circle angel,
perhaps.</p>
<p>There are also thoughts of infinity. We are very clear… okay, say here:
the alternating knots, their number, is infinite. But they become
infinitely small over time (sorry, “time”) in relation to the infinitely
bigger infinity of non-alternating knots. The infinitely bigger
infinity. This is quantitative infinity, which is clearly a relative
infinity. We want to think, we try to feel, we believe we experience or
are struck by… qualitative infinity. Absolute infinity. That which makes
a nonsense of quantitative relations, of comparisons of the form:
greater and lesser… and yet one that seems, sometimes, somehow, to show
its face in and as relation itself, only the mode is more: my relation
to you, than: my weight in comparison to yours.</p>
<p>I think of fractals sometimes. They sometimes come up around here.
But just now I can’t think why. I only recall that we consider them
quantitively infinite. You can zoom in or out forever, and nothing
really changes, because the essence of the equation, or simply the
mathematical structure, is based on the self-similar. When you have a
mathematical structure that all the forms have in common, are generated
by, you have self-similarity. When people bemoan abstraction,
generalisation, theory, and celebrate the concrete, the specific,
practise — it is effectively this, self-similar, form of repetition, or
changelessness, that they are ‘demonising’.</p>
<p>To catch a whiff of their angel, we take a drop or three from the
vial marked, ‘self-differencing’. Beard strokers, moustache twiddlers,
owlbrow wagglers, and pussy lip pouters, like me, might say something
like, “you are not simply <em>interpreting</em> the poem, the poem itself is
<em>self-differencing</em>.”</p>
<p>So the infinity here, is more like an endless ‘amount’ of things,
yawn, ‘things’, a poem could mean, if you, or many worlds of yooze, kept
on thinking about, or performing, it.</p>
<p>But how is this different, really? In lieu of a mathematical formula
generating a form, we have a linguistic code generating a performance.
Just as the mathematical formula remains consistent, detectable,
present, in each of its formulations or expressions; so does the text in
the reading, whether this reading is a verbal performance or another
text, a piece of criticism or another poem or story.</p>
<p>It is just duck and rabbit, and personal preference, or many paths up
the same mountain, all over and over and over again, isn’t it?</p>
<p>I think it probably is. At least, when we put it like that. The
analogy is correct: self-similarity and self-difference are different
ways of looking at the same thing.</p>
<p>But this same thing, it is quantitive infinity. Self-similarity is
okay with that. Self-difference has issues. It wants to say it is about
qualitative infinity. It wants to make a space in its heart for its
perfect alien egg to be laid in. It just wants to say</p>
<p>Look! It is hatching!</p>
<p>Not ‘I told you so’. But… what a beautiful chick?</p>
<p>Well, actually, we say, don’t you think it is kind of ugly?</p>
<p>Just you wait, they beam, just you wait and see.</p>
<p>…I make myself chuckle, like this. I acknowledge also that it says
something about the problem. That it tries to point to life, the
experience of innocence. Novelty, hope, art, the future.</p>
<p>It is probably wrong of me to expect it to make perfect sense. To be
able to make some kind of verbal formula and say: there, the difference
between similarity and difference!</p>
<p>Is similarity itself? Just not similar to itself, because that would
be silly.</p>
<p>Only, how else could it be different from itself, which it clearly
must be, in order for anything to be… to have… um. A self?</p>
<p>An other?</p>
<p>But it isn’t just a gist. A kind of ghost perhaps, or else that gist
is just too close to geist… probably the influence of that just. It is
dangerously close to a should. Perhaps that’s the problem. Probably it
is. But a should is that much better than an ought. Indubitably, I want
to say, without really knowing what it means. A should is better because
it starts with the shhh it should have gone no further than. But then an
ought sounds like aught which is also a way of saying nothing.</p>
<p>Ridiculous isn’t it? How these things seem to be in there? I mean:
they are. Look! This language is riddled with puns. Perhaps it really is
an angel’s tongue!? A trickster’s knot?! Is yours like this?</p>
<p>Hahaha.</p>
<p>One thing I’m quite sure about is that you wouldn’t really be able to
tell the difference between qualitative infinity and Eternity, which
makes me think I am probably best off just leaving the infinite to the
mathematicians.</p>
<p>The time / space division there is curious to me, but it might just
be an artefact of that same split we see everywhere, that is somehow the
heart of what I am saying, anyway… That’s curious then, if what this one
side wants to point to is the split itself, which it keeps realizing
isn’t really there, which is what it is actually trying to say — oh the
folly! — and yet whatever it does, try as it might, it cannot identify
with ‘the other side’, who seem to have absolutely no problem, in terms
of having it all sown up in terms of making sense and being
demonstrable.</p>
<p>My side says self-difference, but in any rational demonstration of
the meaning of this, it becomes indifferent from, or reveals itself to
be the same as, self-similarity… but it feels different. It feels like
it means something else, something more than that, and this feeling
won’t go away, and this makes us, me, here, look symptomatic, appear
wounded or wrong or sick… it <em>is</em> my sickness. This is what I
mean, and understand, by schizophrenia, personally, the essence of
it.</p>
<p>Essence, self… those are the problems!</p>
<p>I don’t think so, snake tongue, let me see if I can go on worming my
way into and out of them.</p>
<p>Are they a logical block? A machinic limit? An organic oversight? A
conversation between God and its angels, overheard? A weird whisper?</p>
<p>Shut up a minute. We say without speaking (the only way to really say
it).</p>
<p>We look symptomatic, because (or, in that,) we display or enact the
problem. It clearly aggravates us. You look autistic. No, you seem
wilfully blind or else simply incapable…</p>
<p>The only medicine I know for it really is the heart, and breath. It
is there in my chest, the answer, and it is quiet. It is careful,
because it knows it can only be beautiful, and how ugly this can get. It
needs to learn. It is asking for it. Asking for all this that knots it
up and burns it. It is figuring something out. It only looks like it is
figuring out figuring out… it is our problem: getting lost. Not
theirs.</p>
<p>And yet it is they who became the lost. So whose fault is it? Was it?
Will it be?</p>
<p>If we are open, they are closed. But then we are closed to something,
and it is not so simple as being closed to being closed. They are open.
We are not closed. Somehow revelation is itself a communication problem.
But revelation is disclosure is discovery… the problem seeks no other
answer than its own evaporation, ana-nihilation… because it cannot
disappear, any more than the river does in becoming a cloud. I just
mean, as nice as it would be, I don’t think the answer is
metacommunication, or communication about communication. But then, I
don’t think the problem is interpersonal. It is fundamental. It is
Reality itself.</p>
<p>It can’t be far from Nirvana, what I am saying.</p>
<p>But what meaning can Eternity have here and now… a here and now which
is non-apocalyptic, the usual one.</p>
<p>Then it means Apocalypse, I realize.</p>
<p>Yes, I sigh, but that is not what <em>I</em> meant.</p>
<p>Are you talking about Imagination again? the Good Beast offers
sweetly.</p>
<p>Hehe, I suppose I must be, smiles the wizard.</p>
<p>Thee Wiz-tard, writes the writer.</p>
<p>I have never seen the eye of the dragon, we realize, quietly. I can
see it, but I have never seen it. Now all I can imagine is a flickery
green lid with purple veins in it. How is it that I know the eye is
gold? Rich gold though, between the frog and the toad.</p>
<p>I must have seen it.</p>
<p>Who told me its story?</p>
<p>It was this place, remember? This place that is not not you. You can
only think of becoming it because it is your origin.</p>
<p>Source is a better word.</p>
<p>It’s eye is my heart?! I write a gasp, but reality just keeps on
breathing calmly. Nothing surprises reality.</p>
<p>Does anything ever surprise you, reality?</p>
<p>It becomes a tiny lizard then, looking over its shoulder at a great
darkness.</p>
<p>Your own thoughts? As it were?</p>
<p>I am not reality, anyway. I am Plaizyal.</p>
<p>I know. Your eye is my heart. I always thought you had two of them?</p>
<p>That is curious, yes, I can feel it. Each side of your body is a
different dragon, but this is your person in completeness. You are a
pair.</p>
<p>It is the eye that faces me that is always closed somehow. Here in
the hedgerows of Winding Brook your eye is always closed.</p>
<p>But your twin is watching my back. And your other eye is in another
world, in which the forests you came from have not disappeared. And the
other eye of your twin is the dreaming that world came from, what
sustains it.</p>
<p>I feel like it is probably just indiscipline, it seems absurd, but I
am thinking about Sunday Underwater. About Sirendos. I was thinking
about it this morning, you know. In the dark, trying to light the
bonfire of my heart, forgetting I was most probably underwater.</p>
<p>I see that your four eyes, which are not not one, must be akin to
their seasons, but I don’t really want to equate them at the moment.</p>
<p>So I will. I will say Winding Brook is Spring, even though I know it
is not that simple. I suppose your other eye, the one that opens into
our past, is somehow Summer, The eye that is watching my back has to be
Autumn then, it all makes too much sense, that her closed eye would then
be Winter.</p>
<p>But here’s what I do and don’t get: how I have brought seven into it.
Or if I haven’t, which I guess I can’t have, how that fits? I think of
it like this: it would make perfect sense if it were eight, because then
we would just have four between the four, like with the wheel of the
year.</p>
<p>I wanted to remind myself not to forget, not ever to forget, all
throughout this story, that the seed of the seven is Sunday. All the
action springs from the idea of a day of rest. It is this day of rest I
am trying to protect. This is the source of my suffering. My creativity,
also.</p>
<p>I can see there is a bridge there… here, I was going to say, what day
is it?</p>
<p>I have to go and check the calender. Jeudi. Thursday. And Mary adds:
the presentation of Our Lord. It is the very beginning of Spring. The
moon is waxing. Growing. Things are beginning to.</p>
<p>It is not Sunday, but there is an important way in which it always
can be, in which it is in my heart. It strikes me this is important not
just for the way I thought, the way I said: that it always is, that it
is present in anything, like the light beyond light… it is important to
see that in the other way: that thus there is no need for Sunday. This
is my folly then, or it can be. It means that if I try to be right about
it, everything will go wrong. I cannot fight for Sunday, literally. And
this is precisely the sense in which I am a warrior. Knight.</p>
<p>But Knights have no place underwater, not really. They are there
though, because Sunday is.</p>
<p>Anyway, we have made the point about the way in which it is a
disappearing day. This is the key to the mystery of the seven.</p>
<p>Not that it needs a key.</p>
<p>Not that is ever has or ever will lock itself away.</p>
<p>This is just a way of talking about how strange it is that we can…
seem to… close to it. It can seem to be elsewhere. There are ways in
which it is, but all seeming ways. When we are closed to it, we only
seem ourselves. Most everyone is busy seeming. It is scary to think of
not seeming. I have to breathe, remember how scary Sunday is. How
strange it is to be underwater. How strange it <em>seems</em>.</p>
<p>In this conceptual loop, or interdependency, the days of the week
arise from the sacred spaces between seasons, which must be something
like your bodies, dragons, if the seasons are like your eyes? But I
understand it doesn’t quite work like that. I understand that, as I
understand it, it does not, because it is not, work.</p>
<p>Between the seasons, themselves a way we mark the rhythm of changes,
are smaller changes which are not really there, but have to be: tiny
sundays, effectively. Or kinds of twilight. Logically there would be
four, but because of the nature of understanding necessarily going
beyond the systematic, one pair are one and the other remain twinned or
two. You need at least these three to twine, which is to say tie
anything together. They are like me, Wayback of Winding Brook, and you,
Plaizyal the Dragon, who is Pluxzyal, also. Or when you are one, I am
two: Uncle Wayback and the Anti-Auntie, something like that. It goes on,
twinning back and forth like this, analogous to how numerical infinity
can be reduced to plus one. Something like this is the engine of us
all.</p>
<p>Taking those four seasons, and their three gates, we can come to the
measure of the seven. The seven is more like the three than the four,
and the three can be seen as the four with a twist in, but my own
musical preference, I intuit, is to hold the seven and the four together
and let the three be a kind of silence between them. I think this is my
understanding of how my Sister’s practise came to called Eleven Healing.
I am quite mental about it, clearly, but it is not knot theory, or
confusion practise, which is to say there are ways in which I am very
much hands on.</p>
<p>All hands on deck, says the captain of the ocean upon which there can
be no ship.</p>
<p>The seven days become seven rings or zones within what the
inhabitants of Sirendos — the Sirendhi — call The Colour. It is, or wiz,
not not our ocean. It will be much simpler if we just imagine it another
world or a different dimension. You dragons are of the land, and so this
ocean is of the air, somehow, but I think making too big a thing of this
can only confuse people.</p>
<p>The outer ring, or day, is what we call Sunday. Or: that is our word
for what this something is for them. Obviously the entire thing is a
kind of translation. We wonder if we can’t… put pie? What the fuck am I
thinking? …if we can’t unconundrum the similarity-differencing-thing by
just acknowledging the self finds a better seat in a phrase like
self-transformation? It doesn’t change much, just seems to make the
problems a little more useful? It is clearly the concept of self itself.
But then, no-self is not not, isn’t it? Otherwise we would actually be
having the realization?</p>
<p><em>Behaving?</em></p>
<p>Ogham’s Eraser strikes again!</p>
<p>The outer ring is Sunday and to be honest hardly anyone ever goes
there even on Sundays. It is closest to that whiteness we could call the
white out if we weren’t so sure we already had a better name for it?</p>
<p>I’m sure it will return to us.</p>
<p>In the centre, the rocky part of this ocean planet, is the
blackground. A sacred mountain rises from the blackground and cuts
through all seven rings to protrude into the white world, or whatever we
call it.</p>
<p>We didn’t realize until this morning that there are hermits who live
on this mountain. It is important to go and to listen to them, but you
mustn’t simply accept what it is that they say. The better ones will
find a way of just telling you this, the dodgier ones will trick you
into realizing it, which can hurt, and the worst of the lot don’t have a
clue about it themselves (and I don’t recommend trying to teach them!)
Weirdly enough they often have the biggest followings.</p>
<p>The seven days are seven ever-present layers or rings, then, as well
as part of a linear method of time-keeping, or sub-dividing the seasons.
The seasons are four states that the entire planet passes through
periodically. One important thing to understand is that this planet does
not spin. It does not have night and day — around it is white space
(which is in fact what they call it!) — there are no stars or any other
such concept of a world beyond, excepting the mythos of Sunday
itself.</p>
<p>You have probably realized this is the concept the people take their
name — the Sirendhi — from? The core of the mythos is a character whose
name basically translates to the-one-who-went-and-got-lost. We will go
into detail about that as and when we have to.</p>
<p>The most important thing I wanted to tell you, was that, because
their planet doesn’t spin, they have no real weather as we would
understand it. We would have to understand their seasons as hormonal, or
chemical, and indeed they are associated with something analogous to a
reproductive cycle, only the Sirendhi don’t just reproduce themselves
but the entirety of their biosphere, or life on their planet. They less
have sex than broadcast something like spores. The differences between
us are really radical when you get into it. It is a wonder we can
understand each other at all. That we can is all down to this conceptual
bridge, or portal. But…</p>
<p>I am getting ahead of myself, too deep into it, and my shoulder is
aching.</p>
<p>I should probably stop. You can see how close to the surface this
story is. How long it has been brewing. I don’t think it is even a very
big thing. Just has plenty in it. Qualitive infinitease n’all
this-that?</p>
<p>Maybeep.</p>
<p>It was mostly something about those hermits, I realized, and wanted
to record…</p>
<p>I can’t think what it was.</p>
<p>But I know it is there, I can feel it.</p>
<p>Very likely this is enough. Surely it is better than too much.</p>
<p>It is 10:45, I will have lunch. Take my head out this increasingly
roomy arsehole of… haha… mine.</p>
<p>(Only insofar as I want to give it to you, I realize.)</p>
<p>Parp!</p>

<hr />

<p>Two or three things, rush cos cook</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>migraine info show</li>
<li>climate extreme but not out of line</li>
<li>up out of the ocean</li>
</ol>
<p>…just expand on them when not in rush (order in fact was 3 1 2)</p>

<hr />

<p>I have more time, it is gently bubbling away.</p>
<p>It is kind of obvious, only I hadn’t really tied it in like this, the
connection between the Sirendhi mythos and Evolution. It was clear
enough that it had something to do with a spiritual transition, or
death. I didn’t see how it also connected to evolution, and in
particular the coming of the sexes and sex. Or the coming and going of
such.</p>
<p>Thus the Cuckoo Working is still making itself felt. I am a little
bothered by the idea of going back into it this year. But I will do so.
I worry: One, that it is a distraction, because it is over and done or
my heart isn’t in it or my wanting to continue it is merely an artefact
of its leftover energy — what it built as it spent something else. Two,
that I will have to deal with the Black Fool. I don’t know, there are
things I am looking forward to about it as well. It is a good
experiment and this time there is no form on the page but the page, and
so it will all be down to trusting the Cuckoo. You fool!</p>
<p>The reason you don’t want to listen to the hermits is.. manifold. At
the end of the day you need to sure for, if not of, yourself.</p>

<hr />

<p>The other thing was to record the idea I had during my migraine last
night, which I know is not an original idea: that it was a kind of
information being sent to me.</p>
<p>I recall that it was thinking of Jung’s God that might have sparked
it off. Someone said that Jung’s God was… you know, Phanes or someone,
the one whose name is the root of phenomena, and fantasy, and
appearance.</p>
<p>The scintillating nature of what I was experiencing seemed to have
some connection to it. I asked myself: what God is this? What does it
want?</p>
<p>(I always remember that thing Jung said, about the infernal endless
croaking of the frogs. Something of the Blakc (huh, a Jungian Slip!)
Black Fool in this. Some kind of overlap between where he was when he
got The Seven Sermons, and Winding Brook.)</p>
<p>I was rather Raging. It might just have been hunger. (Hunger, Anger,
Danger, I thought, curious.) But I felt it was connected with the
migraine as well. I was angry with it. I told it in no uncertain terms to
find a less stupid or harmful way of sending me information, or trying
to tell me something, if that was indeed what it was.</p>
<p>It is only that I feel some kind of download unfurling this morning,
that I return to the question of it with any seriousness.</p>
<p>It could be a <em>kind</em> of information. Maybe I am causing it
though, by becoming overactive somehow, about andor within a field that
is ever-present.</p>
<p>Which reminds me: the hormonal-conceptual weather systems of
Sirendos: obviously in such instances we cannot say who is causing what.
In one sense the weather is a manifestation of the Sirendhi’s actions,
in another it is the motivation for them.</p>
<p>This is probably how it is with Gods. With us and Gods.</p>
<p>With the Imagination, or Phantasy, or what have we.</p>

<hr />

<p>Lastly then, just that it struck me that the seasons do not seem out
of line to me. Not far out of line. One of the ways my thought says
this is: The Climate is Not Wrong. It feels extreme, but on time.</p>
<p>I do believe — yes, for me it is belief, even as I have been paying
attention all this time and convinced myself with what I consider to be
the evidence of my senses within this short lifespan, even as I give
great weight, I really do, to scientific consensus (I do, my Chou, I
do)… I do believe in anthropogenic climate change. This is our fault, we
are causing it. It is right because we, some of us, were, are, wrong.
But there is nothing to dispute, for me, nothing to prove. You don’t
have to go far to see destructed environments. Even the countryside is
one. You don’t have to be essentially antisocial to feel the presence of
too many people — even as we clearly, in theory, have more than enough
food for all their mouths and more. More than enough room…</p>
<p>We don’t, I’m sorry, not really.</p>
<p>But it’s okay, it’ll take care of itself, nature is like the truth in
this way.</p>
<p>It <em>is</em> the truth, for me. I mean: for me that is really what
nature means.</p>
<p>I still think natural is a useful word, and means something, and
tends to be better, even though I would still take artificial blah blah
and stick artificial blah blahs on the end of my blah.</p>
<p>Stupid cunts. Remind me not to make of myself such a stupid cunt,
sometime, please.</p>
<p>Thank you, yes you, you fucking dickheads.</p>
<p>Aren’t we though?</p>
<p>Be alright though, won’t we? I’m probably just hungry.</p>
<p>Weird how I keep on eating my own imaginary waffles, when there is
leek and potato soupage to be slooped down just an ever-open room
away…</p>
<p>Sorry, it’s written now, I expect it is somehow useful, if only as a
negative result.</p>
<p>Just invisible glory through this one guys. You’re probably looking
for something flashier?</p>

<p>Eating, reading — was wondering the question of if the previous
months would retain their being written descendingly? and found the
almost success of the crow poem, which I have to write properly here
now, in case I didn’t get to it elsewhere:</p>

<h3>Totem Gesture</h3>

   <p class="stanza">
        <span class="line">I sampled flight<br /></span>
        <span class="line">through a grid that split the grey dawn sky<br /></span>
        <span class="line">saw the crows unable to defy the great tree’s gravity</span></p>
   <p class="stanza">
        <span class="line">In the dead centre of one plot<br /></span>
        <span class="line">above the uncoordinated curb<br /></span>
        <span class="line">the silhouetted gesture of a robin suddenly appeared</span></p>
   <p class="stanza">
        <span class="line">A distant crow made a break in the garb of a sparrow<br /></span>
        <span class="line">almost drowned, pulled down in a fluster of strokes<br /></span>
        <span class="line">by the foreign clothes of too great a space</span></p>
   <p class="stanza">
        <span class="line">But he made it.</span></p>

<hr />

<p>I think that December could work backwards like that. Might try it. I
have this bastard Autumn though, which I suspect I do need to open with,
despite it coming before the break, in a way.</p>
<p>I’ll have an after lunch tea, look at it a bit but then go outside.
My arm hurts. My right shoulder. It’s this, typing all morning combined
with wrenching wood about all afternoon. But it’s more the typing all
morning that feels excessive. Maybe I should analyse my desk? (Did the
psychiatrist’s couch find its genesis in just such an analysis?) I mean…
maybe I need a fucking office chair. Or to have the laptop on a higher
level and to be standing? I’ll ask the internet if it ever comes back.</p>
<p>It was good at stuff like that.</p>

<hr />

<h2>12:35</h2>

<p>Maybe I’ve just overdone it, over-exposed myself to myself, but I’m
not feeling Autumn at the moment. There are bits of writing in there
that I appreciate, and I think some poems that I might like, and I can
see the sense in which it is part of the story.</p>
<p>But maybe somehow it is more of the end of a previous chapter or
work, than directly part of this one?</p>
<p>The vision, of my friend Christ, or whatever their name or title
might be (surely it is not not that, not not them) — it is a quiet
culmination. Somehow it renders what I had thought a new beginning… what
<em>was</em> a new beginning… more of a between time. I needed the break. I
needed the crash, the technological failure.</p>
<p>It was here, inside the Solidstate Enigmatrix and Archives, that I
started Wayback’s log phor real.</p>
<p>And it maya swell be over by Spring. Even though that’s us just
getting started. We’ll see. It works better to be in it, though, somehow
bearing it all in mind.</p>
<p>What came before, it is just like I thought it would be: something I
need to print up, scratch about, fit back together, do something else
with.</p>
<p>This, this is more or less what it already is.</p>
<p>Just needs combing.</p>
<p>Won’t make it any less hairy really, just a little more looked
after.</p>
<p>It’s nice to comb stuff. Maybe I’ll plait it?</p>
<p>—seventh of february now, she groans, the fucking internet!—</p>
<p>Maybe it is already plaited? And that’s how fairy knots happen? Silly
people trying to comb the fur of beasts the Fairy Queen’s already
plaited?</p>
<p>Then it would be unlucky to try to untie them because you would
probably end up accidentally undoing the Queen’s Plaits as well?</p>
<p>Nonsense of course.</p>
<p>Maybe a fairy knot is nonsense?</p>
<p>Unlucky if you find out what that means.</p>
<p>But we have to start somewhere, eh?</p>
