<h1>25th February</h1>
<h2>08:37</h2>

<p>Had a little meeting regarding the Witch’s Ball yesterday. Went over
to Sebastian &amp; Geraldine’s house, literally over the road, the big
new build that broadcasts kids playing football most afternoons. Their
garage was host to our witch’s broom making workshop. Just them, Yann and
Nat, and a nice old couple of retired English people who live just up
the road.</p>
<p>He used to look after cows — “what, like a kind of Cow shepherd?” —
“yeah, well, Cowsman, or Herdsman if you want to be posh about it” — and
she has a cauldron in her garden. And a whistle for calling to owls.</p>
<p>It was fun, nice to get out a bit, and it took some of the pressure off
having some English people to talk to.</p>
<p>I asked Nat for more details about a story she had mentioned
when they popped round the other day. Something about a goat on mont
Doville. I was going on about the ram’s grave in the parallel reality
again and they were trying to think what might’ve triggered it. “There’s
the goat story,” she said, “but that’s a goat.”</p>
<p>So I asked her to tell it to me anyway. It is soon told:</p>
<p>A goat was being chased by a wolf on mont Doville (the hill
next to the witch’s hill, Étenclin). It tried to take shelter in the
chapel but the wolf followed him in and the doors closed behind them.
The little goat ran to the back of the building and just managed to squeeze out the small door near the altar before that too closed behind him, leaving the wolf trapped inside the
chapel.</p>
<p>“Interesting,” I said.</p>
<p>It is, don’t you think? There’s something in
there, something to it.</p>
<p>After making a bunch of brooms and taking a few photos we went inside
for coffee and cake. Chou and I sometimes joke about their house because
she heard they had designed it with getting old in mind, so I was on the
look out for chairlifts and assistance railings, but apparently it’s
just the size of the doors or something — nice and wheelchair friendly.
We’re the mental ones of course, making it so we’ll have to stay on our
toes until our last breaths, more or less. Still, better like this. More
‘us’ at least.</p>
<p>The Witch’s Ball is scheduled for Halloween. We’ve got the <em>Troc des
plantes</em> — seed and plant exchange — in April (there’s a photo with me
and Chou in, in the local bulletin, taken at the inaugural event last
year: “Huh, they’re faking my involvement in the community,” said the
witch). Also the commune has been included in some sort of cultural programme which is taking
the historical witch trials as part of its inspiration. It’s all just
come together fortuitously apparently. They’ll be talks and walks,
and some people out and about gathering local stories and legends.</p>
<p>I wasn’t looking forward to it in the hour or two before I went.
Been quite tired recently. Was massively revitalised by really
surprisingly clear second day of meditation — after fighting a drifty
drowsiness the first day — but then the third day was slightly agitated
and restless and was interrupted in the middle by footsteps on the
gravel and a loud “Il y a quel-q’un?”</p>
<p>The telephone people finally came to fix the internet. I’ll be able
to read about the sex lives of woodlice again! Won’t forget how much
I’ve enjoyed being without it though (at least for the most part).</p>
<p>So anyway, I was glad I went in the end, and it was really nice to
walk back through a different gate and come back across the Echoing Green. Felt
weirdly different. Chou and the bunny were weeding in the front garden
when I arrived at the house, made her jump but not him luckily. The sun
had come back out while I was walking and as we talked a hare showed
itself from behind the ruin — two tall ears edged by the late afternoon sun
— I said Hello Beauty as it bounded up through the arboretum and into
the brambles.</p>

<hr />

<p>In other news I finally managed to program my smart lightbulb, thanks to the return of the
internet. Set up a routine called ‘smart poo’, a simple cycle through the rainbow.</p>
<p>“You’re a big kid,” she said.</p>
<p>“Come on, you have to admit you’re impressed? You can have a smart
poo!”</p>
<p>Some of the purpler colours are a bit offensive to her sensibilities
but I wanted to go full rainbow at least to begin with. I might try a
warm orange-yellow-green version though. The only problem is that at the
moment I have to bring the lightbulb into the lounge to program it as
the wifi can’t get through the thick stone walls. Happy spaceship, anyway.</p>

<hr />

<p>I suppose I will have to find some other way of doing justice to the feeling
of being inhabited by Cuchulainn last night. I’m reading the Tain and thinking with a certain horror of
all those places being named for people Cuchulainn slew,
but there’s something about the violence there that feels somehow elevated
by its matter-of-factness. I think about the aboriginal dreamtime: the
lives and deaths of their gods continually creating the landscaped now from the
eternal hyperspatial sideways. However warlike the people of Ancient Ireland were I just get something
more imaginative from the story, the feeling of something else going on.
Of course there is the memory of fallen warriors but somehow that doesn’t
seem separate from what today we might imagine as love, as if the violence
is something we project back into the past because of a way our minds have
changed here in the future: our misunderstanding and not theirs. It is very
evident that there was all kinds of honour involved, that
people stuck to their oaths even more profoundly than as if their lives
depended on it — it is as if that is the force that once held the world together
and not the physical illusions we use to spell our fates today.</p>

<hr />

<p>I lay late in bed this morning. Could’ve snoozed more still. There’s a sense of someone more intelligent than I am talking in my sleep, or
whispering in my half sleep. It feels less like what is going on there
is just fuzzy nonsense, and more like I am the one who is lacking in not
quite being able to translate it. It was really laying something out
this morning, and then when I tried to get a handle on what it was, how
I might say it, words like truth and reality come in — and I swear they
weren’t there before and they don’t quite fit. They’re not outright
wrong, but maybe it’s all the worse in their being not quite right — in
the sense of a little ill-fitting.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I could even conjure an ounce of it just now. The
interpretive section had something to do with a definition of the real
as that which… not reflected, not embodied… the truth. What is real is
more or less that which has truth in it. Was this truth any closer, in
the half here?</p>
<p>It was the same truth as ever, the one meaning, that which is beyond
stillness and movement… but. But there was more clarity about it being
an absolute relation, without the sense of attributing anything to it by
‘saying’ that.</p>
<p>There was insight into the different meanings or showings that are
present in seeing the knots as made from the loop or unknot, and seeing
a crossing for what it was, or seeing it from the point of view of the
crossing, rather.</p>
<p>Some kind of idea that the metaphoreal was in the bringing of ones
self into line with the truth. It feels so empty and dreamlike and
illusory to say it here. This feels more the dream, more the
half-asleep, than that did.</p>
<p>Just one of those cases of leaving it do its thing, which is not this
yet.</p>
<p>So much of what I have to learn, or learn to remember, seems to
concern timing. Right time is right place, so probably I’m thinking
Justesse. The right kind of right… and the right kind of wrong.
Same!</p>
