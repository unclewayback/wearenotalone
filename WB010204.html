<h1>4th February</h1>
<h2>07:49</h2>

<p>I need to build a kind of sustain pedal for silliness, and just keep
it pressed down.</p>
<p>It’s not an easy balance, being this unbalanced.</p>
<p>Serious business, being a fool.</p>
<p>To be earnest and silly, I mean, more particularly. That’s quite a
challenging combination, I think. On some level it has to be a fight
against something then, but in a way it is a fight against what others
might think they are fighting. A serious person is fighting something,
the only way to really fight something is seriously, surely? Otherwise
it’s marshmallow mallet time? A person in crisis is serious. An
existential crisis, for instance, is a serious confrontation with what
it means, or is, to be alive andor human or whatever, andor modern etc.
Sure, absurdity is part of that. But absurdity isn’t really silly.</p>
<p>I don’t know, really, what I’m on about yet. Only that I seem to
knock the wind out my sails often enough, and yet I keep coming back to
this place or person. I begin to wonder: if my work somehow depends on
creating a certain mood, if it only really works in this small band of
possible feelings, or a certain niche of being… then I just need to
realise that and do my best to ensure I am creating it. I need to really
acknowledge it. Hence silly sustain pedals.</p>
<p>I mean, it is not necessarily an overly restricted emotional range or
anything, maybe even too loose, over the top, a bit too much… what do
you call it? Ah yes: it is faintly hysterical sometimes, isn’t it? Is
it? I think it is, but when I come back into my own fold, it is so,
because of some stone wall of unfeeling which is not the holy wall of
perfect rage whose face is unmoveable truth (the wall with nothing
behind it, the wall that is the void itself). It rails instead, when it
does, against masks, surely it does. And of course there are issues with
this. Not all masks are bad. A silly sustain pedal would be a kind of
mask, only… if a mask could be evaporated and become an atmosphere… if a
fart could be a mask. Something inappropriate but funny, in a childish
way, perhaps, that you forced out accidentally on purpose.</p>
<p>Hang on a minute, it’s probably just time for a poo.</p>

<hr />

<p>Anyway, I probably <em>should</em> make a proper study of nonsense, silliness,
the absurd. I know I said they are different, absurdity and silliness,
but they are certainly part of the same — hmm, sam, I wrote —
complex.</p>
<p>I need to make synths sound like birds. (The dawn chorus is on at the
minute, you see.) I think perhaps I could move some way towards it using
a bit of random and arpeggiation.</p>
<p>I don’t really like beats, even though I do. But I would like to be
beatless for the most part — fluid like nature seems, or feels most of
the time to me. My heart though, and chant… like stamped feet. Trance. I
do want beats, just…</p>
<p>it all has to be right. I went at it very quickly yesterday,
necessarily, and one day I will get to that kind of efficiency, but I
still have plenty of setting up work to do. A little wonkiness on the
pitch helps. It doesn’t have to not be a preset, or presets, just the
right ones is all. It’s only sometimes it doesn’t matter… but then all
the time is sometimes, which is why it always matters.</p>
<p>He’s not not making sense. Just has a funny way of going about it.
Still, we’re probably better off for a bit of that in the longrunning
meantime int we?</p>
<p>Have a look at yesterdodd. Try to build a bird machine. Two things
you could do today, quite apart from whatever — as we sigh — else needs to
be done.</p>
<p>Oh let’s just try a quickie something less, like…</p>

        <span class="line">in the same way that all you really want to give me is myself?<br /></span>
        <span class="line">The truth rages immovably beneath the dream skis of bed sledge,</span></p>

    <p class="stanza">
        <span class="line">beneath the ash or snow or moon dust of an undying love<br /></span>
        <span class="line">that has to always mean more than we can ever think it does<br /></span>
        <span class="line">so much that sometimes it will hurt to feel what we most deeply need to mean</span></p>

    <p class="stanza">
        <span class="line">And how it has to already be, like the ends of our lives<br /></span>
        <span class="line">plaited together like hair whose end is always there<br /></span>
        <span class="line">but how in living our deaths like this we become anything</span></p>

        <span class="line">but zombies, more like goat’s beards than zombies, more like<br /></span>

        <span class="line">Don’t go getting lost, fix your one and only thing to any old beam<br /></span>

<h2>18:51</h2>

<p>I hope I don’t unlike it again later, definitely felt like I made it
better this morning. Enjoyed it actually — giving it some space as well
as tying it together here and there, taking some of the thickness out,
but ending up with a sound that feels more coherent. Still talking
nonsense, of course. But no amount of fiddling about is gonna change
that.</p>

<hr />

<p>“Trigger warning trigger warning! The reason we say it twice is to
give time for metacontrarians like me, who sometimes find themselves
triggered by trigger warnings, to adopt a defensive position, which they
can do surprisingy quackly…”</p>

<hr />

<p>Do you remember that time those guys chased a robot here? And
Wayback stood at the gate and wouldn’t let them in after it? (Even
machines have sanctuary here of course, mostly just the Black Smoke we
try to keep completely out, the Blue and the Grey are all good.) Anyway:</p>
<p>“This is Holy Land” he goes to them, all stern and prophet-y, with his
staff and all — but then he turns round to me and whispers, with a glint
in his eye: “Well, there’s some water, too.”</p>
<p>Of course we even have the no fly zone now-a-daze! Things’ve come a long way since we consolidated The
World Next Door. It’s The World Outside The Outside World now, all the
way!</p>
