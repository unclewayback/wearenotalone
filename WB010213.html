<h1>13th February</h1>
<h2>07:20</h2>

<p>I thought about that Old White Wolf. The fact it was an autopsy,
together with the dreamer’s femininity, made me think of the times I
watched Chou cutting up whales. She was trained as a vet, and was for a
while a member of a voluntary group of ecological scientists who would
conduct research at the beachings of ocean mammals. First time I joined
her for an autopsy was down in the bay of the Mont St Michel, where I
watched with admiration as she parceled up a Beaked Whale. Dark grey
pink blubbered beast of the deeps. A mother, if I remember correctly.
Stranded on the glaucous salty vegetation, the abbey on the mount rising
up in the background.</p>
<p>It made me realize that the White Wolf connects to the White Whales
somehow. I don’t know much about them yet. They appeared in a poem
called A Fifteenfold Binding of the Ungléshan Language Demon. And they
are also in Public Transport. It was when I felt threatened by
solipsism, or some kind of derealization, a few years back, that I first
comforted myself in the feeling of being a creature of <em>their</em>
imagination. I wasn’t dreaming all this up, it was they who were
dreaming me. Us, really, because how can it be solipsism if I am no more
real than my friends or family or anyone else, if we are all projections
of a singularly strange dreamer?</p>
<p>The White Whales have something to do with Tether, and their realm is
not the SEA, as in the Solidstate Enigmatrix and Archives, but the
actual oceans of the earth, which are still out there and not just in
drone-docs.</p>
<p>The image is… as if you go out into Thee Wylds and you go deep deep
down into the real sea, you keep going until it’s so dark for so long
you forget almost everything — and then you start to see the great ghost
lights, and you start to hear their songs, and you begin to remember a
thing or two, and it’s not like you’ve gone under and in, anymore,
because here you are in the over and out…</p>
<p>The Great White Whales are sailing between the stars and we are
riding in a chariot they are pulling. This is a good way of seeing
Tether, that which connects the chariot of our reality to the directions
they are dreaming us in, the force of the way they tend — a kind of care
by which the direction is found, the seeking of which is all our ups and
downs, even the tilt of the earth on its axis.</p>

<hr />

<p>I am looking up into the stars with my breath steaming into the beam of
my headtorch, my own little joke of a star. I’ve been doing the last
of the day’s horse duties and now I’m probably having a wee. I’m
wondering how many writers there are up there and if any of them are
getting it right. The pool of earth-words is already quite a tide to
feel lost in, but it’s different somehow to consider it in universal
terms. Perhaps that’s what the stars are? Famous cosmic writers? Worlds
the gods like to read? Or perhaps no one’s getting it right yet? We’re
all still muddling along being better and worse? Or else it is all
perfection. Sometimes that’s the weirdest bloody feeling of them
all.</p>
<p>One thing I know is that there are not infinite writers,
quantitively. The analogy, a fairly direct one, would be to letters in
an alphabet. We are a finite bunch. We may be a very large number but
whatever this is it is dwarfed by our output, which is definitely
infinite. Of course this is where the analogy breaks down and becomes a
metaphoreality, for the quantitive finity of the letter-writers and the
qualitive infinity of their work-worlds are measures of a very
different kind, in that one cannot be. Cannot be measured, though of
course it is replete with a universe of rhythms. The link there being
the notion of a musical measure. Sorry if it ruins it to point that out.
Just trying to be helpful is all.</p>
<p>— Lôrien sighted at the bottom of Samael’s Field on Oberon’s
Path! —</p>
<p>So, there are concepts here, but I don’t really have concepts, it’s
true. I do have ideas, but I’m not really sure that me thinking them
pure is correct. I need them to live. I want them to make examples of
themselves. I want these examples to show me what they are in a way I
cannot grasp, cannot exhaust. Clearly this is poetry, whatever form it
apparently takes. If I become too conceptual I am getting further from
my source, which is also my target. So it would not be correct to think
about embodiment as a goal, if anything it is more of a side effect. I
need you to presence. That an idea presences is really what imagination
means. When I try to imagine an idea, or hope it to come in to my
imagination, I am tri-ing to conjure a presence.</p>
<p>I suppose we all have different ways of understanding that. For some,
a concept is exactly what it means for an idea to be present, for
others, it is more like a character in a story or… a kind of suggestion
just over the horizon of an event. That hazy limit which makes a scene a
scene. It doesn’t have to be foggy. It is elfland. Twinelight.</p>

<hr />

<p>I think I could be quite a horrible person, if my art always went
wrong. Maybe that’s why I have more sympathy for misery guts than some.
Such an attraction to the apparently negative. I don’t know. I do know
that I worked for a long time, sank many hours into that piece I may or
may not have ‘pasted in’ above. Twelve Twelve Twenty-something. This
morning I can value that experience for all that has gone wrong about
it. Last night, fresh from sinking another couple of hours of my life
into its unlight… Not.</p>
<p>It’s just after 10pm, I should already be in bed, reading, instead
I’m sitting back from the screen and saying, Well that’ll just have to
fucking do I’ll look at it tomorrow.</p>
<p>Have you finished writing?</p>
<p>Yes, I say, grumpily.</p>
<p>Do you want to get some fresh air? She smiles, cheekily.</p>
<p>I suppose so.</p>
<p>I do, I need it. So I’m out doing the late horse shift. Feeding old
Boby, giving them all a good stack of hay, picking up a few shits. I’m
pitchforking the hay into the big round black thing. Yer all just shit
machines. Enchanted my arse. Just big dumb beasts who shit a lot.</p>
<p>That’s me, my Knight name: Sir Shitsalot.</p>
<p>Except for you, Ginger, you’re not just a shit machine. You’re a
fucking meta-shit-machine. A shit machine with another shit machine
inside it.</p>
<p>Oh but we thought meta didn’t mean that anymore? Now it meant Among
didn’t it Mister Knot? Great wise one as you are, shifting the meaning
of ancient words? Fucking twat! You’re a shit machine among shit
machines!</p>
<p>I’m joking about it today, and I was saying all that out loud last
night, so at least making fun of my misery, which I wouldn’t have been
able to do once-upon-a-time. But the foulness of the mood is still real.
The darkness of the perception is true.</p>
<p>Somehow this is all an act of will. This work, that you can feel a
bit of here. Magick.</p>
<p>It has become necessary that I do it. This Mad Work. I have to stick
to it. At least to a certain point. There is something I need to see
through. There are plenty of ways I will accept… need to learn to
accept… failure…</p>
<p>But I will not fail you. Amulet. I will not fail you.</p>
<p>That piece of writing (from yesterday and every yesterday there ever
will be), let me understand it as a successful failure. To understand it
as a failure, and to let it go, that is success. If I do that, I can see
how to save it. Just because it is a failure, it doesn’t mean there are
not precious things in it. Perhaps it couldn’t even fail were that not
the case.</p>
<p>The work comes from a period when I was beginning to think more about
the human voice, about the nature of natural speech — albeit in the context of ones trying to say something for, or to,
themself. I like that word: themself.</p>
<p>So I would try talking instead of writing. That time I spent an hour
or more talking into my phone. I’d woken with that phrase in my
head:</p>
<p>Glimpses of the being I am dying into.</p>
<p>I recounted various recent events, as well as reporting on current
ones: the sights and sounds of my walk. The hunt was on, in the woods I
was in, I could hear their shotguns. Followed a surprised deer away from
them. Thought about how different the sound of an arrow zipping past my
ear would feel. Wood passing through the woods.</p>
<p>I’d been starting to read a little about Western Music Theory and
listening to a little more Classical. That crept in there. The human
voice is a continuum, a spectrum we can freely slide up and down. Vowels
live like sentenced things inside consonant punctuation. Dissonance is
an idea. No, a feeling. The twelve tones of that theory, one way you can
look at it is like only being allowed to paint with primary colours.
Trying to express an angelic oil painting you can see in your mind’s eye
with sugar paper and poster paints. It’s not true, or doesn’t have to
be. There are whole worlds of opportunity crammed into every set of
constraints. Learning and creativity aren’t really so different.</p>
<p>I’ll try not to be ungrateful, next time I have to learn the value of
not trying to make something something it is not.</p>
<p>Don’t blame the spade for not being a fork.</p>
<p>The beast is never wrong. Nor is a crazy person. You are
mistaken.</p>
<p>My metafictional counterpart to Raymond Soulard Jnr’s The Wobble (a
kind of Catastrophe at the origin point of our Cosmic Diaspora) is an
idea from someone else’s Universe: Joel Biroco’s Equilibrium. Together
they metaphorealize for me a kind of secret that is far beyond Entropy,
but can seem a little related. As if you could grasp the significance of
those mirrored equations: physical entropy on the one hand, the tendency
of energy to dissipate, to distribute itself evenly in some more or less
ideal space. (Sorry, I know I’m jumping around. It’s a lot to keep track of even
for me. Even especially for me.) Informational entropy on the other: a measure of the signal in the
noise. The same equation, just a reversed sign some place, a negative
where the other is positive.</p>
<p>(Neither entropy, nor negentropy?)</p>
<p>The Equilibrium is like a future state. One of the things it means to
me is a form of Immortality. We must know better than to take such ideas
at all lightly. I feel that if you really want to understand
Romanticism, as a cultural moment or movement, then you need to
understand the ways in which it is a traumatic metaphorealization of our
potential for a kind of actualized secular immortality. This is a big,
eye-burning picture to imagine that you might see, because you can’t
taste it without tasting immortality.</p>
<p>There can be only one, and all that.</p>
<p>Anatheism is an atheist heresy. An exponential one. Heresy to the
power of.</p>
<p>The Equilibrium is a taste of what we could become, or perhaps have
or must become, should civilization be able to raise itself to the level
of culture. Should civilization be able to fulfill the promise of
culture, we may achieve Equilibrium.</p>
<p>Strange, scattered, scintillating — I hope, I trust — sayings in the
moment.</p>
<p>I read Mister Biroco’s Black Over Bill’s Mother’s, recently. There
are moments I feel like I am hearing the voice of the commander of
Spaceship Earth. Others might only detect the ravings of a mad man. This
is precisely how it seems it should be. You are a great comfort for me,
and yet a challenging one. It is the third of that bevy of books of
yours that I have read, and my favourite yet. Remind me to thank you
for it.</p>
<p>I realized I could save that piece of writing, that particular
experiment, this morning. Those awkward, flawed treasures that confound
me — having aspects that hook me too deeply to want to let them go, but
the whole somehow warping my perspective in a way I could never put
right. Writings I have wronged for myself by spending too much time in,
by trying too hard to have them become something their encoding is just
not suitable for. I don’t know where or whose is the flaw, only that it
is not the perfect kind of flaw. Floor. My own frustrated ceiling. Give
it up.</p>
<p>Let it fall apart. Fragment. It is not even alive enough to fester.</p>
<p>Shatter it. It always was a shattering, anyway. Look at the
translucency of the… not light… colours. Like stained glass but not.
Like the bomb that shatters the old cathedral’s window. How much you
loved that window, the way they’d made no attempt to reassemble it
sensibly. It couldn’t be done. They just put it all back up there in a
kind of beautiful puzzle. That <em>was</em> the solution. Beautiful.</p>
<p>For a colour to be translucent it has to be a space. It doesn’t suit
the ideas we have about colours as a kind of reflection. A waste
product: the leftover light which whatever the surface cannot absorb. It
is more like what it seems, like filtration, the colour is light passing
through a space of colouration, it is the vision of the space itself.
The world becomes like this. This is how the trees seem. How that little
robin appears. It is not different from the memory of your dreams. They
come to life here, it all intermingles.</p>
<p>It is a dream cathedral.</p>
<p>A kind of graphic novel. Things happen in frames.</p>
<p>You see a car travelling along a long straight motorway. You can hear
the classical music coming from inside. You don’t know which tune, you
just have the radio on.</p>
<p>This is how you get to the forest this time. You drop her off at
wherever she needs to be, and you carry on into the woods. Pull up
somewhere random along the road that passes through them. Get out, start
walking.</p>
<p>Hear the birds now, let them tune you in. Become sensitive to the
smaller musics of the wind. So that the big gust becomes a
revelation.</p>
<p>In the wake of it, feel the sounds of the traffic fade back in.</p>
<p>Zoom out. Up. Zoom up.</p>
<p>The road, the motorway, it is all part of one great circle. A ring
road. A great circle passing all around the forest. That’s why you had
to stop somewhere random. You came from nowhere. You come from the last
time you saw this. This is what random is.</p>
<p>You can hear the horizon. The traffic becomes the wind again and the
wind goes on, goes back down to the ocean. You feel like you are on a
hill now. Now is this hill. Time is like an ocean lapping all around it.
A flood. It is a flood of time. Time is all around us. Not just behind
and in front. But the flood is a flood of the past. No. It is a future
that never happened.</p>
<p>No. It’s now. It’s now again. Keep walking.</p>
<p>You are driving around inside you. The day known as yesterday. It was
misty, more than misty, foggy. You were on your way to a different
forest, perhaps?</p>
<p>It’s all the same road. It goes up and down. You go down now, down
into a big dip in the fog. The sun is trying to slice through it. It
turns the world into rooms. Or cake. It is you who are slicing through.
It is purgatory. This fog is the breathing of ghosts. The presence of
shadows. It is a slow quiet storm of opacity. The road rises up now, on
the dip’s other side. Maybe that is heaven? But it seems cold. Like the
house of the giant at the top of the beanstalk, if a beanstalk could
grow in the winter.</p>
<p>The cloud becomes darker. Maybe there really is a storm brewing?
No. You are slowly being struck by black lightning. Little veins of
darkness reaching up into the cloud. The storm is The Witch’s Mount.
Maybe even her steed, why not? The blank trees of winter are lightning
in reverse.</p>
<p>You are home, somehow. Maybe you have a headache because part of you
is trying to figure out how. It’s like the storm is in your mind. The
unstorm. I suppose the great ring road must have an other side. That
must be here. This must be where we live. What we do when we are not
wandering around in forests. The car is filled with saplings. You left
them sleeping all over the folded down seats.</p>
<p>You are tying knots in scrunched up pages of newspaper, to light the
fire with. Snapping in some little sticks and stacking some kindling. You are
just about to light it when the starling flies out.</p>
<p>It is panicked and confused, it flies into the painting. The storm
above the ocean that is The Monk By The Sea. It recovers and does a
one-eighty only to smack into the window instead. Do you take it in your
hands or does it find the open door for itself?</p>
<p>Or had you lit the fire already? Did the bird come out burning? Didn’t it
bounce around the room like a tiny phoenix in reverse? Didn’t it become
another one of your projects? You tried to heal it didn’t you? Until you
realized it was a tiny overcooked chicken who would never fly again and
then you smothered it, snuffed it out, took the life you saw you had
selfishly attempted to extend.</p>
<p>No, you wouldn’t do that. You were probably just in a bad mood.
Seeing things. Even if it couldn’t fly, couldn’t live a proper bird
life, it would be your mate instead. It would be sat on your shoulder
now, telling you not to write that thing about your willy again. What’s
that mate? Oh, you’re just hungry! Let me grub you somethink up.</p>
<p>Probably you were trying to be too refined. Too cultured or
civilized. You’re not a brute, clearly, but you’re just too fucking
kinky. Don’t try to fight it baby. It doesn’t have to be dirty. Let them
think that if they want. Allez tous vous faire foutre? Something like
that.</p>
<p>Just remember the pictures. Draw it sometime instead of trying to
write it again and again and again. But when you do write don’t forget
to write stuff like again and again and again. People need to say stuff
in their heads at least three times sometimes. You know some folk
probably read this shite on the diagonal? Can you imagine being skim
read? Would your voice go all high pitched in their head? No, it would
probably just glitch, start granulating, become a burble of mostly
missing bits.</p>
<p>That’s why you have to take care of yourself. That’s why you have to
learn this stuff. Imagine you understand something about what beauty is.
But in a weird way. You just can’t read like that. That ain’t your kind
of sponge.</p>
<p>Permit yourself one quick flash of that exotic and eternal ocean, but
you are not to go swimming in it. Today is not the day to dive in.</p>
<p>Hehehe. It’s kind of funny. That little seasponge.</p>
<p>Thank goodness we invented metafiction. Even in reality, wherever you
are, there is a way to turn your head that is like… like moving from a
screen to look out a window. If you are looking out an actual window,
perhaps it is in your headphones, or perhaps it is time to look back at
the screen. But if you are looking at a screen it is probably out the
window. Maybe it is time to have a fag break or a cup of tea, if you do
those kinds of things. Maybe you need to stay with it, keep focused on
what you’re doing, if you are driving say, or doing brain surgery or
conducting a dream autopsy for a class of perfect students. The window
might be behind you then. Like a woodlouse breathing out its bum.</p>
<p>Can they really do that Grandad? Even underwater?</p>
<p>It definitely was a problem for you, depression. You did beat it
though, didn’t you? Whatever that was, even if it was many things, even
the way in which it was nothing… somehow you cleared that hurdle. You
still have all kinds of issues, and a whole world of not-my-problems,
but not that one. Something a bit like it sometimes pops back up, but
it’s not what it was. And now your mania isn’t just an attempt to escape
from that. It’s wild again somehow, somehow you set it free.</p>
<p>I guess you had to become the sanctuary, which is something like the
memory of a ruin before it becomes one. I mean, you had to embark upon
the construction project which is indeed a sort of deconstruction. You
<em>did</em> have to fixate upon the metastructure. You might have to do so
again, from time to time. But it is like… like making a wildlife
sanctuary in what was once your own private insane asylum, and then
gradually letting yourself realize that the sanctuary has no fence.
Whatever you had to protect stuff from just isn’t real anymore.</p>
<p>All at once you are homemaking, you are cosy in front the fire with
whoever or however you imagine something like a lover and a pet. Two
kinds of very kind companion who will have to be considered both
completely independent, and something you can depend upon so deeply that
in some very real way they are part of yourself.</p>
<p>The mystery can be absolutely expressed as being part of something
which is only, which is and only is, a part of you. The strangely
impossible symmetry that everts itself into something like chirality for
oddities like you. Like us. Like understanding. Substance. Meaning.
Ahablaha. Absolutely and yet not totally. A different kind of kind of.
Metameta, have you ever met a meta meta. Not Not.</p>
<p>Who’s there?</p>
<p>Not Not.</p>
<p>Oh, there you are!</p>
<p>Taaaa… da.</p>
<p>Cosy in front of the fire and ruined and open to the sky. Same time.
Cleaning and dusting and tidying and covered with ivy and insects and
arachnids. Those spiders are your thoughts. No wait, the idea is one
just got eaten by a bird.</p>

<hr />

<p class="stanza">
<span class="indented-line">Concentric bubbles<br /></span>
<span class="indented-line">of lives burst into<br /></span>
<span class="indented-line">This bird-filled world.</span></p>

<hr />

<p>You are a place. Or will have to become one if you want to know what
a place is. If you want to metaphorealize it as a caravan of caravans it
is that. When is a place not a place?</p>
<p>When we’re a person?</p>
<p>Who knows!</p>
<p>Beneath the floods of time an ancient forest lies. Rises with the
more extreme of tides, when the moon helps make the sea even more
asymmetrical. You are an oddball.</p>
<p>Maybe you really did get struck by lightning? Or I did when you did?
Whenever that was?</p>
<p>An interesting kind of broke.</p>
<p>Not exactly voluntary poverty but I guess that could be one way of
saying it.</p>
<p>If permaculture actually was a kind of haircut.</p>
<p>It would be a mullet, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p>Not likely.</p>
<p>Sorry. This is the stream of consciousness version of what planting
trees would be like if it was just a single tree on a hill that is not
not an island which is not not a planet who is not not a person, whose
head was in the clouds of neverneverland and whose feet were firmly
planted on the ground that is eternity. Oh, it’s just what it means to
plant your feet. You have hands because of the dream you must reach for
but not reach. And because trees have roots you have feet. But only
because God is a kind of non-existent tree.</p>
<p>I would like an off button for this weird kind of truth, but I
already know that I have one and where that is, my problem is that I
have to half sit on it in order to write anything.</p>
<p>We’ll get there. We’ll learn to focus enough at least once upon a
time to write a proper story. I would like to imagine it didn’t entail
actual physical labour, but it does. I need to actively and physically
reshape my environment, realize certain material transformations, in
order to produce in actuality what is theoretically already possible.
Metaphorealization.</p>
<p>You are not wrong, in stating that it is a form of discipline. I mean
it is discipline, pure and simple, no form or kind of about it. It is
absolutely discipline, but if you think this is something you can force
upon yourself or someone else, you know less than not even nothing.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s what this — that — force is? That would be weirdly like
the poetic meaning of gravity, if we could see love and rage as
different ways of looking at the same thing. Duck-rabbit. Or different
projections of the same knot. The innocence in or of that. That is what
we must seek to experience. There are two many ways I can only be wrong
about it. Even to myself I give the wrong impression.</p>
<p>Until I am able to some degree to relax, into what that resistance
just is. Already always. Not a bad phrase.</p>
<p>I seem to remember something about a flock of pigeons?</p>
<p>Are there pigeons in your forest? I guess that’s what wood pigeons
must be.</p>
<p>What am I trying to remind myself of? This needs to be the end of
this!</p>
<p>We will stop before we come to the Yews. Before we return to those
great dark trees again. They who for us may as well be immortal. Some
kind of a future state that there was, in the deep deep past. Still with
us. Not that. Not yet.</p>
<p>Hold on a minute. A moment, I mean. Just a handful of breaths, a
softening of shoulders, a heartbeat of feet. A seat. A seat I can
remember they are dancing from. I forgot that, I am sorry. But it’s
okay, isn’t it, when you are sat down, to forget that there are dancing
gods?</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>Bear with me then.</p>
<p>I will first have to feed the birds.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And let the horses back into the field, it’s nearly Eleven now.</p>
<p>Go on then.</p>
<p>Right. Right quick I’ll finish this, then I’ll take the bunny out for
a walk and pick up some shit alright my love?</p>
<p>I think it must’ve just been the sounds of their wings.</p>
<p>All bird’s wings make different sounds, and flocks of them, and
different-sized flocks, all different sounds too. It probably has a lot
to do with scale. But it really is a feather that tips this kind of
qualitative scale.</p>
<p>I will have to write that poem sometime. Sometimes, I wrote,
accidentally. The one that could start</p>
<p>Heron does not flap, but strokes the sky.</p>
<p>And a sparrow will not clap every time we get it right, but that’s
another poem. A different one.</p>
<p>It was quite something, reaching up to pour the bird seed into the
little house that hangs from the yellow willow. The arch of yellow
willow. Its branches, the fresh bright growth, going up into the clear
blue sky. Little bluetit comes to perch on one, hungry little monkey.
Hello Bloop, I say. Bluetits are of the day, but Bloop can be a bunny of
the moon, as well. I need this kind of freedom, though it plays havoc
with me. That I can change day into night and bird into monkey into
bunny, it is the same kind of impossible possibility that makes those
machines in hospitals that keep people alive literally.</p>
<p>I could die, and those machines would keep going. You’d keep them
going. Because there are as many writers as there are stars and they’ll
keep the many worlds turning.</p>
<p>It sounds wrong sometimes, I say it wrong, but I mean well, I mean it
right. I’m weird enough to know what that is, just like you probably
are.</p>
<p>I was in here conjuring a kind of mist. Writing into a world of fog,
when the brilliant day was outside. But that is fine, even perfect.
Reality is a kind of imaginative weather, and the world is indeed a kind
of mist swirling about in a limitless nothing. But we are not not the
light shining on it. The clouds are sliced in the most… fantastic
fashion. It is great. It is bright and colourful and whole worlds of
good hidey grey.</p>
<p>There are so many possibilities. I think this must be my fascination
with the idea of necessity. I reckon it must be a kind of trauma for me.
I start thinking that, for a mathematician or someone, it could be
probability. I claim, truly but over-emotionally, that for me it is a
matter of life and death. I understand that for you it is not not
survival. It’s important to us all in different ways.</p>
<p>There are starlings on the bright bare oak watching me walk down the
path. And back up it.</p>
<p>I don’t want to reduce it to trauma because I don’t want to reduce
myself, my work, to that. But I am thinking about a wound. I am
thinking</p>
<p>It is like the wound we have to make in the page with the point of a
compass if we want to draw something as supposedly simple as a
circle.</p>
<p>It is even just a wound like that.</p>
<p>A hole in the big blank page.</p>
<p>But we are not a blank slate.</p>
<p>This is a wound we bring into the world with us. To feel the hurt of
it, to let yourself be irritated and weirded out by it, somehow that is
the heart of an artist, or the path of a poet. That is what is
necessary, or perhaps what necessary is, for us.</p>
<p>We all have our issues, we carry a variety of different wounds and
scars. But that one belongs to everyone. Whatever it is, it belongs to
everyone, and us to it. There are at least two ways this helps, or can
help.</p>
<p>One is that it can make light of whatever other wounds you have. You
can use them to think about this, to perceive and explore reality. Like
senses, really, really like senses and in at least those two senses.
Your wounds and that wound, our wound, they make each other important,
significant, without that wound having to justify the ways it happened
that you got hurt. It’s not that kind of cause and effect sort of
reason.</p>
<p>The other is that this is everybody’s problem, perhaps even or
especially when it is not. But I could probably unsay far too much about
that. It is the main way I go wrong, or feel unkind. A bit like logic
gets mean or angry, when it can’t force the tortoise or whoever to see
or accept something. Except it is only a metaphor for logic. No! sorry:
logic is a kind of very dry metaphor for it. At least from my
perspective. Or this perspective, sorry!</p>
<p>So that is the one problem that really can be, or could be, The
Answer. Somehow.</p>
<p>The pigeon’s are flying around in the forest. Slightly darker grey
shapes in the soft grey mist.</p>
<p>You are watching and listening, but somehow you still don’t notice
it.</p>
<p>You do and you don’t. You notice it, but by then it has happened. It
feels instant, but you know it was not.</p>
<p>It really is as if the sun came closer. Just a touch. Just
enough.</p>
<p>Maybe the wings of the pigeons somehow thinned out the cloud.</p>
<p>Maybe you really are a tree. Somehow you seem to see by touching
things without touching them. Like that willow beneath the oak, the way
it looks like somehow they know each other are there, in a way that is
more perfect than one just sensing the other’s shade. But it does have
to do with light. Surely. Not eyes, but light.</p>
<p>But we don’t mean it literally. We mean what it looks like.</p>
<p>But the only way to say that is what it is.</p>
<p>One thing responding to another, while the dream is of the thing
beyond between.</p>

<h2>12:50</h2>

<p>Okay, quite a lot of nothing just happened, again.</p>
<p>I went down to remind myself of what the willow and the oak actually
look like, which wasn’t how I remember. It was at least last year I
first saw it, but I don’t think that makes as much difference as it
should. I would have to draw it, but even then I’m not certain that I
could.</p>
<p>Basically the younger willow is very clearly the one getting out the
way of the old oak. So even if you take this literally, as if I am
asking for some kind of scientific explanation (which there is a way in
which I am), even then, if it is just about light and shade and a bit of
wind and such — what I am saying is less about the willow getting out of
the way and more about how perfectly the oak seems to be ignoring that.
As if the very way in which the oak is aware of the willow is in the way
it is apparently ignoring it.</p>
<p>As if instead of looking at the lovely imposing curve of the bare oak
branches — it’s a young oak, actually, but older than the willow — and
instead of looking either at that or at that and the lovely way-giving curve
of the young yellow willow… I’m looking at how they both make or
contribute to that lovely space between them. The way they are each in
their ways curving back, at a limit of sorts, seems to be lifting that
space into the air, and this makes it look like what I earlier expressed
as them being aware of each other.</p>
<p>Even if it has nothing to do with awareness, it has everything to do
with beauty, or simply aesthetics, the sense of senses (when it’s not
busy claiming to be the imagination itself).</p>
<p>So what it looks like means how it feels and this might be the
essence of Psychedelic Analogic, of which the metaphoreal is my
metaphorealization.</p>
<p>How it feels is like it is saying…</p>
<p><em>You don’t have to know it, for it to be true.</em></p>
<p>It is saying this both to me and to you, whichever one of us thinks
we are the willow or the oak or not, whoever thinks they are the writer
and whoever thinks they are the doctor.</p>
<p><em>You don’t have to know it, for it to be true.</em></p>
<p>Otherwise I am just following the bunny around with the camera,
thinking of making a video of just that, with a narration that you don’t
have to listen to, if you just want to watch a bunny bouncing around,
which I obviously do too, otherwise I wouldn’t be filming this or
talking about it.</p>
<p>Why bother talking about yourself if you always are in a way?</p>
<p>The horror of that! Thank fuck for science. I’ll take refuge in that
sometimes, as well as the dharma. And the rest of it.</p>
<p>Hello, my name is MC Sam Knot, welcome back to the Haunted
Microphone, whether you know that you know it or not, I’m an
experimental writer of metafiction. That’s what this is. My problem is
just that it’s what it already was. So why don’t I just tell me, sorry
you, why don’t you just tell me about our day, and let’s go on all night
about it sometime. Answers on a postcard to please get in touch at you
cannot not dot dot dot… calm.</p>
<p>I’ve seen infinity, okay guys? That’s all it is. No need to be scared
by that look that’s in the hare’s eyes sometimes. That’s why it’s in the
hare’s eyes. A gracious animal. Darling creature.</p>
<p>So it’s hard not to imagine I’m still going on about it.</p>
<p>That’s the kind of way I’ve kind of been traumatised, quite apart
from all the other ways thanks mate. Sorry you can feel sorry for me, if
you like, instead of being disgusted. Or both, I don’t mind.</p>
<p>It’s given me a pretty odd sense of humour. A pretty odd sense of
things. In general, whatever they blah. Odd though, definitely, else how
else could I ever let you get away with saying Zero is even.</p>
<p>Okay, let’s call it even.</p>
<p>It might not, in the end, be that I’m just talking about myself even
when I’m trying not to. I might really be saying something. That,
somehow, is what I think really saying something means. It can’t be
about me. Or not only. And so that’s the essence of the not not stuff,
only it doesn’t reduce to that. It has something to do with the only
kind of only that there is, which might even be the only kind there
isn’t. Weird hey?!</p>
<p>So this is the way in which I think it might be a kind of Queer
Theory, only I’m not exactly gay more a certain, even uncertain, sorry,
kind of good old fangled happy. I don’t want to offend anyone, and I
will try not to, but obviously if I worry too hard about that… wouldn’t
that be the really offensive thing? Wouldn’t that be me calling you a
dumb cunt without you really realizing? Maybe I should try that more. In
that glint of the eye way that’s the luck of the Irish.</p>
<p>Anyway, it is not really theoretical. And so not, that it is not even
non-theoretical. But when I say shit like that it starts getting highly
impractical. So I’m just a freak, and this must be what Confusion
Practise is.</p>
<p>Not Knot Theory is probably best understood as a kind of semi-private
metafictional language that I’m — we’re — all of us here at The Winding
Brook Sanctuary for Ultraterrestrial Life — we’re still developing it.
It is still in development. But it’s even kind of meant to be a bit like
one of those things you could just never finish… or, even more
self-doomingly, it is meant to be <em>about</em> that! I suppose that so
long as about doesn’t have to mean that it literally is about or around
it, like a container of some kind, then that’s fine. We could be about
it just by being among the things it is.</p>
<p>Or could be? Nope. The things it is. I just almost misspelled is so
many times it became a kind of mantra. Si o I as if fy! It has to be
what it is, not what it could be. There’s a way in which it can’t not
be, but that way itself has to not be. That’s as clear as I can be. I
know it sounds awful metaphysical, and it might be. Today at least.
Probably you won’t think of it like that by the 23rd Century, which is
when all this is happening anyway.</p>
<p>And I’m already dead. And so are you. Welcome to the Haunted
Microphone. Please leave a massage after the maybeep.</p>
<p>Thanks guys. Sorry. Thanks.</p>

<p>(By the way does anyone know what February means? And if there’s any
significance in the fact it sits between old back-and-forward face on
the one side and Mars on the other? It’s not just the name of some
twatty arrogant emperor is it? I hope not. The internet’s broke so I
don’t know.)</p>
