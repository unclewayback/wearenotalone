<h2>06:49, WB</h2>

<p>Mushi will go to the vet this morning to have the metal removed from
his leg.</p>
<p>Maybe the phone people will come to fix the line.</p>
<p>I feel my relationship with the internet has changed a little in the
meantime. I have the sense that I don’t want to let it back into my life
to the same degree as before. I don’t want it always on, the go-to thing
to do when munching or at a loss for what to dooze. I vill be ze mastah
ov yoo now internetz! Mark my wordages!</p>
<p>There are things I’m waiting to do with it, mind. A thing or two to
download, and some questions to research.</p>
<p>Let’s stop being so boring though, just for a monwit, and wronk a
poem.</p>
<p>Called</p>
<p>You Have To Be In The Wrong Mood</p>
<p>No, Titles should come at the end.</p>
<p>Hmmm, that wasn’t meant to be a title, but I think is a better
one.</p>
<p>Atchoo atchoo bless me now get on with it</p>

<h3>Titles Should Come At The End</h3>

<p class="stanza">
        <span class="line">A house full of muffled meanings<br /></span>
        <span class="line">to bother the peripheries of your non<br /></span>
        <span class="line">sense making: the awkward-bottomed passenger<br /></span>
        <span class="line">who rides the day car’s to do list<br /></span>
        <span class="line">into the instant sunset of that one<br /></span>
        <span class="line">fly-squashed thought, the afterthought of whom<br /></span>
        <span class="line">is always you should have been kinder to.</span></p>

<p class="stanza">
        <span class="line">A head fool of insignificant things<br /></span>
        <span class="line">making purposeful mistakes in the game<br /></span>
        <span class="line">we call life is not a game, unless it is<br /></span>
        <span class="line">all the same to you, Strange Peacock in the long gone<br /></span>
        <span class="line">life tree of the unreturning unrelenting spring,<br /></span>
        <span class="line">constant wood fountain of the drum<br /></span>
        <span class="line">whose every slow slow beat overlapping is the hum<br /></span>
        <span class="line">of hardly heard imagination. Or is it? I can’t quite be sure.</span></p>

<p class="stanza">
        <span class="line">A handy body laid open to grasping erosion as if<br /></span>
        <span class="line">somewhere between the antiriver and ungravity<br /></span>
        <span class="line">a single-feathered beyond could snuggle its<br /></span>
        <span class="line">straightfaced smuggled goods<br /></span>
        <span class="line">into the Big Bad Wolf World of granular analysis —<br /></span>
        <span class="line">mooded atoms of schizophrenic greatness<br /></span>
        <span class="line">bow-tied with light and shuffling into the hanging hall<br /></span>
        <span class="line">where at last the unnumbered shall be weighed<br /></span>
        <span class="line">and counted altogether golden one stubbornly museful lump.</span></p>

<p class="stanza">
        <span class="line">An unrealized ending tethered frayed<br /></span>
        <span class="line">to the brave fiery face in the mirror of the waters<br /></span>
        <span class="line">wide mouth hot with intemperate sayings<br /></span>
        <span class="line">about of and or else any other operative it can’t<br /></span>
        <span class="line">get its rough-lucked tongue round, its not-saying<br /></span>
        <span class="line">nay-roar, burbling rush of languaged liquid<br /></span>
        <span class="line">like<br /></span>
        <span class="line">the beak-gift of a phoenix to the chick of its chosen world:<br /></span>
        <span class="line">My Happy Sickness Names You Father<br /></span>
        <span class="line">(and blurts out the whites of the eyes)</span></p>

<p>Big low thud on the window to the right and behind of my head</p>
<p>Great Fuck Off Starling Of Shit! I exclaim</p>
<p>I hope he’s alright, she says</p>
<p>Was it a starling? I ask</p>
<p>Yes, he just flew off, she informs me.</p>
<p>Jolly goodage, I imagine.</p>
<p>Weirdo, I think.</p>
<p>Hungry, I write.</p>
<p>Hungry.</p>
<p><em>Chilli non carne</em></p>

<p>intriguing mention of Equilibrium in Ehrlich’s Hunting The Faster
Than Light Tachyon, end page 55 start page 56:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to “Niven’s Law” of time travel:<br />
“If physical laws governing our universe permit the possibility of
backwards-time signaling or time travel which can change the past, then
no devices for doing either one will be invented.”<br />
In other words, a message sent to the past alters the entire future
history, including the sending of the original message and its content.
The altered message will change the past in a different way, and so on,
until some “equilibrium” is reached — the simplest being where no
message at all is sent. Backward time signaling thus erases itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>…cool ey?</p>
<p>(meaning is itself a wormhole?)</p>
