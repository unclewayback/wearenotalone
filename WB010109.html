<h3>The Loss of Yesterday</h3>

<p>See through, not with, the eye, they say. And so it is with Place and
Gate, in a way. The analogy is indirect, but that bit the better for
it.</p>
<p>I stop. A good place to rest from my journey. Make a pause, have a
break, kick back.</p>
<p>Need to feast my eyes on hereness. A gentle relent in to and fro.
Listen, reach into my unrhythm.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>No footsteps sound upon the stream. Light the dappled whisper of
trees. Damselfly applause the only breeze.</p>
<p>Could be fairies. All them little shine magnets. What else but the
glitter on The Gate?</p>
<p>You glimpse, a glimmer, that is what it means to see through. To
barely see it but to know. Something of another world in this.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>To see through is not to not see it, like some with their eyes. Walk
about looking without seeing the seeing and you int really looking is
you? Int really delving intwo one.</p>
<p>Oh you see the eyes alright, but without even realizing. Eyes on
stalks, red lights in upsidedown black domes, eyes behind the words of
advertisements. Feel the eyes on your back, speak the eyes in your mind,
read them from their face books.</p>
<p>To see through is not not to see it. You see the place but you know
it is not not The Gate. You see The Gate too, the one you come and go
through, that which does not move by which you do.</p>
<p>… … …</p>
<p>It would seem a gate of iron to me, mine. My blood the rust on its
shine. My breath the threshold I dwell upon — and no mistake in
that.</p>
<p>It would seem a gate of stone. This world the green-gold lichen that
gobbles it foreverly. That makes a beach of moonlight jewels, jewels of
algae, glaucous algate under the stone’s feet, I think?</p>
<p>It would seem a gate of trees. Just another random gape in a forest
of unmade decisions. A child’s game you just realized wasn’t quite.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>For the ungarra bunga tribe of dolalally dip The Gate is of course a
Vagina. For the urban burgulurs of the bone pyramid of cerulean The
Gate, naturally, is Death. It is said that for the scholars of jerubum
The Gate is an impossible surface, not unlike our own.</p>
<p>Our own Ungleshee Garden Gate. Our own-faced fate forgotten. Our own
garbled eden between convertions, conversations, and conservation.</p>
<p>Regardless of what I say The Gate remains The Gate, but not
regardless of how I say it, for what else is there to see through? It is
fine to live in an unliteral bubble of human being so long as the space
we blow about in is that much the greater, which is to say The Good, of
which it is the uppermost perfection to be told it doesn’t matter by.
And this the primal mirror of the arbitrary, of which the random is but
the exponential ghost, of which a certain kind of chaos is the infinite
erroring of.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I am sorry, Old Soul, just bear with me, please. Let me try to relax
my grip on what it is I think I should be saying. Say the only thing
worth wanting has to be as close to nothing as we can get, yet without
that meaning lost.</p>
<p>I shall crunch a mental apple, in lieu of her hooves upon gravel, and
endeavour to be less oblique, excepting the wisdom of approaching
something shy. Someone shy. Just shy of what they cannot help but shy
away from, a kind of noise that is not this good stream’s signal.</p>
<p>This burble and flurt, flather and foam, gentle natural drone. An
unmachined hum. The substrate of a song called Understanding.</p>
<p>… … …</p>
<p>Say meaning is like the bridge that crosses this little brook back
there. The lovely limper’s bridge, its cobbled hump making music with
the wheels, meeting their rounds-and-rounds with a stubbornness of a
different sort. An arc from the other side, unlike and not unlike them
circles.</p>
<p>Dash it! Meaning is like the bridge because the bridge is like The
Gate because places are the river’s cousins. You can’t step in the same
one twice they say, forgetting to add that then nor can you put your
foot in it even the once!</p>
<p>Meaning is stillness, but without a hint of getting stuck. I am
still, beside a constantly refreshing river which, when I get up and go,
remains still in my stead. This is how still The Gate is, and how still
you must be to approach it.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>So still the whole of your flesh can seem a slide. The entire rainbow
of your meaty aging the endless again of a weird circus ride. Wrong
eternity in its striped-candy guise, helter skelters of hollow laughter
as your unmind recites someone else’s metabollocks, the simple trauma of
all ways untailing sometimes.</p>
<p>Being a creature. Becoming a being. The dissimilar unsimulacra that
we cannot quite Divine.</p>
<p>But who is breathing whom? How many degrees are the in and the
out breath different by? How could life, including death, in itself be
unkind?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Or kind. Isn’t meaning itself a kind of unkind? If The Gate is Truth,
and the truth is your truth, and yours must be ours in a sense that is
neither soft nor hard…</p>
<p><em>Steadfast.</em> Gate Truth, Truth Tree. Meaning the living carving of
reality.</p>
<p>I guess it is time to be quiet.<br />
Unless that is what this is?<br />
Hehe, do you read me?</p>
<p>… … …</p>
<p>I stop the recorder and start my engine strolling, so loving the
sound it seems a shame not to have sampled it. So I reenact it for you,
causing a kind of accident by which only said reenaction remains. The
usual sacrifice of time is forever a moment of surprise. But it must be
more than just a rewrite, what survives.</p>
<p>… … …</p>

<hr />

<h2>15:13</h2>

<p>Jusht eeching. Maowf ul. That seemed an example of when to stop,
again. I have to wonder when I’ll catch those. Kind of carried on for
more than an hour once the writing was done, fiddling around at the end.
Have wondered, while cooking, if I shouldn’t take the rewritten at its
word, and do that. Make something of it, that is less like a train of
thoughts in the head of an odd one out. Side in. Um… like… what is going
on around him? More… does a cripple of some description cross the
limper’s bridge? is that why he gets on to thinking about it? is it old
Rodney, who had so many vaginas put in she lost structural integrity all
along one side?</p>
<p>I doubt it.</p>
<p>I do think he seems to have a horse. Like a sort of steampunk
mechanism, proto-FriendShip, in which all that lives about it is his
love. An allegory for the body, obviously, strokes the chin, while a
moment of uncertainty dances behind the eyes, almost unnoticed.</p>
<p>Almost unnoticed, unlike the sound of the neighbour’s tractor
starting up. On a Sunday. A cold sunny Sunday. And Mushi the bunny
hopping back in from a reasonably closely-supervised outing.</p>
<p><em>Hao Mush!</em></p>

<hr />

<p>The eternal lettuce as its own salvation. Salvation as saving. Saving
as archiving. And then: the twist in the tale in which the real salvation is being
forgot. Moments time forgot. Or times the moment did.</p>
<p>That is what Tether seemed to do, before I snipped it out above</p>
<p>— oh, the wife shouting at The World Next Door —</p>
<p>it seemed to intervene, provoked by my — or his — reenacting of the
unrecorded end, that seemed somehow the perfect punctuation mark — a
holy fool stop — Tether glitched out the Solidstate Enigmatrix, deleting
the previous recording, overwriting it with only the reenacted end, a
poor and silly substitute. And yet the… would it? Would the real hell,
or thing to be saved from, be being saved in the first place? Being
preserved in some kind of mechanical way? Of course, so long as times go
on, even recordings are not fixed… everything is at least as much its
context as itself.</p>
<p>Or is it?</p>
<p>Supposedly an illusion, a construction — yet one that has to cover
some reality, be built upon some foundation… and this being none other
than what it really is.</p>
<p>Which is thus its own non-existence. At least intellectually?</p>
<p>Thus maybe the whole talk is like a trap… the entire chat of
liberation also the poison it would seek to liberate you from.</p>
<p>An argument over some accidental comment you just happened to feel
like insisting upon.</p>
<p>Deletion is so much simpler than atonement.</p>
<p>You no longer really want to be understood, even by yourself. Where
would be the fun in that?</p>
<p>Past the butterror, pleesh.</p>
<p>Masht potato!</p>
<p>Completely random.</p>
<p>One more spoon.</p>
<p>Maybe the more I meditate the less this will be a suv=bstitute for
not doing.</p>
<p>I deleted then undeleted the accidental v= — why would one care about
a sentence like that being correct? A sentence written one handed
between mouthfuls</p>
<p>It <em>is</em> dangerous, then. There is no safe seeking. Was it
safety seeking, the link? Safe is safe, but dangerous is not dangerous.
No, other way around. You are pointing the handle at me.</p>
<p>Yes, that’s right, you are meant to hold the sharp bit.</p>
<p>Risk management is obviously a little dangerous. Nothing that lives
is safe. Nothing that has a life to end. Yet that would make death the
safest bet, when it is apparently the source of every threat.</p>
<p>But there are fates worse than.</p>
<p>Fear of death is the corollary of survival as aim, is the end of
meaning.</p>
<p>Meaning meaning is dangerous.</p>
<p>Good job you don’t have to go looking for it.</p>
<p>Except to find that out, maybeep.</p>
<p>Have a piece of chocolate.</p>
<p>Close your eyes.</p>
<p>(But not for too long, it is (barely) ten degrees in(what passes for
in)side)</p>

<hr />

<h2>18:09</h2>

<p>So yeah, being overwritten by Tether is Salvation from the Solidstate
Enigmatrix and Arkhives.</p>
<p>Redemption is your own rewriting. And writing is (don’t say always)
already rewriting, so don’t worry about that. Or do. But basically… you
are stretching your muscles, say, practising. All this is good in light
of confusion practice, and the unknowledge that perfection is something
just being what it is, such that practice as practice is perfect —
perfection is only something you can unmake, mental like. Not knot
theory.</p>
<p>But in the shadow of there never being nothing else: it is all
wank.</p>
<p>Wank wank wank.</p>
<p>So stroke yourself long and lovely, let yer tongue hang out in
delicious self discovery, as if such a thing could be discoveried, hot
cum of God Sun all over whoever doesn’t want it, no bother</p>
<p>But one day it has to be The Om of Swords or else</p>
<p>Redemption as hardcore as forgiveness. You only forgive someone
because you understand aloneness is justice — either reaching it or not
— blinded by the unseeable — conscious of ones wrong — or manifesting
ignorance in an incomplicit victim… eek. I just mean justice is not mine
to wield, it is something that sometimes happens to me, like a
self-inflicted injury. I don’t know about you, or, god forbid, him,
them…</p>
<p>Staying with the subject then: it will only be wank if it never cums
to nothing.</p>
<p>That you know you have come to nothing already would be a kind of
comfort, then, if that was how it worked.</p>
<p>Instead it is just like you said. Something inevitable, once it
unhahahappened, which you somehow still feel the need to live up to.</p>
<p>You do. These are the needs to have, the ones to want. Much better
than plastics and shinies…</p>
<p>Plastan. Did we record that? The name she gave me for my Satan? I
changed it a bit, didn’t I, to Plastanus, because everythink is better
with a bit of bumhole in… but she thought I was being cleverer, saying
Plastanos, like Thanatos or something. Plastanus. Ahnoose.</p>
<p>Anyways.</p>
