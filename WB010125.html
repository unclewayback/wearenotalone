<p>Couldn’t read me Dante last night. Couldn’t read nuffink, in fact.
Wondered if I really wanted to? Maybe one of them stories I was on
about… but really, thought I should be sat there with a doodle, driftin
off with a doodle. Stayin sharp as a pencil.</p>
<p>I’m living inside this computer at the moment. Want to stop, draw
back. But I’ve got to look at the screen in order to one day not have to
look at the screen so much, it says. Take apart your old forays now, and
salvage what you can of them. Make them nice and modular. Modularize
them. Start leaving yourself the notes you wish you had then. Who would
have thought it was this easy to forget how something you made was
made?</p>
<p>Stop this waffle. Poor Diarist. Wrist? Maybeep. If all of these words
are the not being of other ones you’d rather write. Just keep us
up-to-date if there is something to be kept up about, matey. That
includes if it is just if yer hahahappy, of course. Otherwise, head
down. Serious clown.</p>
<p>Grim fool? No, y dick’edd. Wonkleton Wyrdo. Waffledom Clamb. Not very
grim, really. Though, it is funny, the blackness of peace. The
undetermined anythink necessary of its not doing ness. Yae woodnae
mess.</p>
<p>Cudnae!</p>
