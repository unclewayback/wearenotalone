<h1>6th February</h1>
<h2>07:14</h2>

<p>Nice full moon last night/this morning.</p>
<p>Can’t remember any dreams, but woke at 05:30 to write this in Big Red
Zap Book:</p>

<h3>The Not Too Far Off God</h3>

<p>Yeah<br />
that’s pretty much it</p>
<p>(because where is the target you are trying to hit?)</p>

<hr />

<p>Maybe it would be best either developed or without the parentheses.
Wasn’t directly countering the notion of a too-transcendent, Fuck You
Space Daddy Lord, more thinking of the difference between, say, getting
to a specific star at a certain time, and hitting a target which is
never not there, or else everywhere — if the voyage was into your own
mind or soul, say. Not that you can’t go wrong in this direction, just
that the god of approximations is kind of on your side here, the idea
being that the real way to go wrong here would be to mistake being
right for being precise. For being precise in some sort of here-these-are-its-coordinates fashion.</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s what I’ve been searching for, with Confusion Practise?
A word. A word for being exacting about something very diffuse. A word
that puts its finger on what is so very here we can’t bloody finger it.
That which would transcend everything precisely through displaying an
almost impossible degree of immanence, or hereness. Even an impossible
one. An impossible degree. Somehow different in kind. Because let’s not
kid ourselves that saying almost impossible has any more meaning than
saying almost infinite would.</p>
<p>A word, which is to say a meaning. One that ‘mystery’ can’t quite
manage anymore, if it ever could. Put that finger on my lips again and I
promise you I’ll lick it!</p>

<hr />

<p>Did I tell you I found the water cute this morning?</p>
<p>Can you imagine what that means? <em>To find the water cute.</em></p>
<p>I hope you can, and I hope I won’t spoil it for you. If you just want
to go with your own meaning, pure and uncontaminated, don’t let the
following light in without first closing your eyes:</p>
<p><em>Bleepulladdadeepull wabba shaaba eekell burradalparra dankord
grunchalla wrankalpharter gordel borp!</em></p>

<hr />

<p>There was the bunny, on the little cushion on the floor next to the
wall beside the bed. I have to lean out to put the plug in to turn the
lamp on and I can see the Little Cloud of him in the moonlit night
vision of these still dark mornings. Since yesterday he has somehow been
extra cute for me. Cute like a little old man, not a baby or something.
Not a bunny.</p>
<p>Meditating on the threshold there in the cold early February sun. A
cosmic guard dog of a world where you might just want to watch out for
certain plants or something. You just stay over there, weird green
thing. I’ll come say hello when I’m good and ready.</p>
<p>I’m stroking him. It’s been a little while. More than a day, maybe
two. It would be more like stroking the head of an old person in their
bed, being as cute as a little mamamalien. Oh my goodness, they are on a
voyage through time and I can see this bit of them getting there,
becoming something else they are. I don’t know what it is but it is
cute enough to become strange in this oh so welcome love. Or strange
enough to be cute. He sends that message with his jaw, a happy
bunny.</p>
<p>How in all the worlds of that fur do I imagine I see owlbrows? Big
grey furry old man eyebrows? Why do they wriggle like caterpillars in my
mind? How can they be the cocoons that invisible eyes are born from like
butterflies?</p>
<p>And there was the wife. All wrapped up from head to foot, ready to go
out into the cold and dark, putting the pan on the stove for coffee. Why
was I smiling at her like that? She looked at her reflection in the
oranges upon the moon blue window, adjusted the lip of her stripey black
and white sock hat, waggled her switched-off head torch up and down. She
couldn’t see anything so out of place as to be funny.</p>
<p>You’re just cute, is all. You don’t have to do anything special in
order to be a little bit silly. You. You might not think it’s true, but
I do. I know what you are. I have lain with the devil. But that is
something best put into pictures.</p>
<p>The cuteness of water wants to be put into words.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is simply a particular intensity of love? A kind of
goldilock’s porridge of cuteness?</p>
<p>Can you <em>love</em> water? Do you?</p>
<p>Don’t imagine being really thirsty, I’m not really talking about
being grateful, or having a need fulfilled.</p>
<p>Start with how clear, and yet how <em>there</em> it is.</p>
<p>In the little stainless steel pan it seems completely colourless.</p>
<p>In the big egg-blue mug with the little goose on, inside the glazed
whiteness of that, it seems to have a subtle tint.</p>
<p>Did you notice that you just poured it?</p>
<p>You can pour it. In a way you probably haven’t realized that since
you were too small to really realize things.</p>
<p>It’s just amazing. But it’s <em>cutely</em> amazing.</p>
<p>I wonder if I could tell this water apart from other water in a
double blind touch and taste test? I know that I should imagine that I
could not, but a part of me thinks I could. Obviously different waters
do have very different qualities but it would seem a world away from
wines, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p>There is still a little of the Glastonbury Goddess water in the old
milk bottle on the side there. Iron rich and a little cloudy. You’re
only meant to drink small amounts of that at any one time. You will
feel it in your belly if you drink too much. Sometimes it is good to do
that, to know how it feels to drink just a little too much of something
that could maybe upset your bowels if you drank much more.</p>
<p>This water you could guzzle. Or I could, this time, at the moment. It
is not tap water, and not tested. It is the water from Mary’s Spring,
which definitely has something to do with my ability to find it cute.
But the cuteness has to be there. And I am not sure that calling it
cuteness-in-potentia is that. Is it there, if it is just potential? Is
it some kind of answer, to have the concept actual?</p>
<p>Actually, I don’t know. May every seat be throne. Back in a mo.</p>

<hr />

<p>There is a hand on my forehead.</p>
<p>Not in the same way I sometimes imagine there are windscreen wipers
on my glasses.</p>
<p>Last time I did that, it was the arms themselves, so they had to do
it one at a time. One arm would retract from around my ear while my
spectacles balanced on just one ear and my nose, and it would wipe the
lens then return to resting over the top of my ear, allowing the other
arm to do the same.</p>
<p>It really is remarkable, the technology of the future.</p>
<p>A hand on my forehead. Not a marshmallow mallet on my nose.</p>
<p>A hand on my forehead, stroking up from my brow towards my crown,
gently smoothing my hair, and she is saying</p>
<p>Not a journey through time: a jaunt through meaning. Time is just a
symptom of this. The questing question and all that.</p>

<hr />

<p>The water is cute. A cuteness in its almost colour. In the particular
way it has of saying pure. A mineral rich, liquid stoney, long journey
through the earthy, round and round and sat back downy way of saying
pure. More like pour? Perhaps! Perhaps it pronounces ‘pure’ more like
‘pour’? I always find stuff like that cute.</p>
<p>Remind me not to correct it.</p>
<p>I better stop it.</p>
<p>I better stop being so cute.</p>
<p>Fate says it’s okay, it knows better than to be tempted.</p>
<p>I didn’t just say it was cute. Not without acknowledging how it is
weird.</p>
<p>Weird is Good.</p>
<p>That’s a fuck of a formula. A hell of an equation. A very wonky key
to enter through the back door of an ever-to-be-realized heaven.</p>
<p>Lose it before you use it.</p>
<p>I just wanted to say that I’m much happier, I think, now I don’t
worry about having anything to say. I really like sitting down to write
with nothing to say. Nothing happening. Maybe I’m just happy anyway and
I’m just imagining this is a reason for it. No, I know it doesn’t have
reasons like that. I’m just saying that there is a special joy here, a
quiet triumph. I think I had to go through a long phase of really
worrying what I had to say. What I meant. A crisis of meaning. A
desperation not just to mean something but to know what that is, or
was… and to say it. Even just to myself.</p>
<p>I guess I have done that. Or I do do that now, sometimes. I have
found the way in which I can.</p>
<p>Just… it is a bit like sitting down with nothing to say and just
saying it anyway.</p>
<p>You have to keep yourself entertained. Make yourself happy.</p>
<p>No one else is going to do it, really, until you can do it — at least
on occasion — for yourself.</p>
<p>So don’t worry if it comes out a bit wanky.</p>
<p>That’s clearly the morale of this story.</p>
<p>Glitch it and scratch it and don’t forget to sniff and one day a lot
of the bother will be out the way and you’ll mostly be left with the
magic of gist.</p>
<p>It’s simple but there’s plenty enough to it.</p>
<p>To woo.</p>
<p>To wood, yes.</p>
<p>It will be a cold week.</p>

<h2>13:00</h2>

<p>It’s not Silver Willow Holloway, just Silver Willow Walk. Obvious
when you walk it. We did think of it a bit like a Holloway, but it’s
only half of one. That made me wonder about making a Holloway, whereupon
I realized there is one, only along the <em>outside</em> of one of our
boundaries. Just behind Fae Lurk there — or where Fae Lurk wiz n willy-nilly be. It’s like the other side of Lêrêmann’s Gate in a way, which
seems appropriate.</p>
<p>So then I thought Andor. Is Lêrêmann’s Gate an Andor Gate? If so
what’s that? I thought about those NAND gate things again. Thought that
thought about how, for me, (as if their could be a logical ‘for me’?) um…
‘Not’ is the most meta operator because it can apply to itself.</p>
<p>Then head went…</p>
<p>And And! Don’t forget And! Or Or!</p>
<p>So I was like, but but, guys, that’s not exactly what I meant. I mean
it can apply to itself in a more <em>meaningful</em> way, somehow
self-transforming in the process. Maybe even making a dimensional leap
maybe. But yeah you guys are sweet and I hadn’t thought of that. Of
course we won’t forget you. None of this is about that. We all come
together. That’s the point of the whole thing. Particuliarities in the
singsongularity.</p>
<p>Still interesting to me this idea of NAND andor NNOR as all you need
to build a logically complete system. ‘Not’ as the ur-component. And
different to thinking about most parts, or things, isn’t it? Is it
not?</p>
<p>We shall see. Meta waffley.</p>
<p>So, Andor. You have to be a not either-or gate. An either-or gate you
either go that way or that way, and then you can’t go the other. With Andor
you can or, you could just go one way, but you can go both too. It can’t
just be a simple loop… but might be a bit of one in a way. Mostly it
just feels like it’s a way of preserving some of the benefits of being
able to choose, or constructively limit, without this having to become
harshly exclusive… even though it will have to do that sometimes it is
in a different context, has a different vibe.</p>
<p>Anyway, it made us wonder about reading Kierkegaard. Maybe some time.
Also reminded us, the and and or or stuff, about Wittgenstein — how we
really like that idea of his of a work of philosophy assembled entirely
from puns.</p>
<p>I can’t think the difference between NAND and NNOR just now. Aren’t
they the same? Both not and not? Because a not that or not that..?</p>
<p>I must play with them a bit some time, to get my head around it.</p>
<p>Or get my head a-square it, as the case may beep.</p>
