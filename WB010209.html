<h1>9th February</h1>
<h2>06:49</h2>

<p>C’est Jeudi. Sounds kind of playful doesn’t it? By Jove, I wonder if
play and games descend from Jupiter out here in the Unroamin’
Ompyre?</p>
<p>They may. I always think of walnut’s as Jupiter’s Balls now.
Jupiter’s testicles. My brain is a Happy God’s Bollock.</p>
<p>But enough about that, I’ll get myself excited and I was trying to
avoid that fellow. I worry about him.</p>
<p>Did you wake up in the night? She asked me.</p>
<p>Not unless it was to make love to the moon, I said, and she just took
me up and dropped me back without my remembering.</p>
<p>These things happen. Older-than-houses, she is. Giantess who walks
the night world hills. The moon is her torch. As well as her, in a way.
Same way we are the light we shine on the world perhaps.</p>
<p>Are these all different Goddesses? Or am I coming to one. Would three
be enough for all her faces?</p>
<p>(That reminds me, I was going to swap out facets for facts. Though I
am not sure it is any less unweildy than just having a minor meltdown
every time. Can I get back to you on this one?)</p>
<p>Nine?</p>
<p>Not likely.</p>
<p>She is one for me, and she might as well be God (Sorry Darling, I
don’t feel like capitalizing your She all the time, it is a bit too
dominatrix). But I could never make light of all the differences.
Especially the dark ones.</p>
<p>The cuckoo is coming, and he is in your hand. You could be Mary in
these sweet lamb spring times. The cuckoo could be dove. But it is not.
Could be a sparrowhawk, but better shush about that. Weird as fuck mush.
She is screech owl eyes in the unseeing night. Athena, were the wisdom…
somewhat less civillized.</p>
<p>It is a great glorious mess. A kind of ripeness. If a fruit that will
never be ready could be said to be ripe.</p>
<p>It is no joke. She terrifies me sometimes, in a way He could never
hope to. I would fight that fucker, Him, to the death, armed to the
teeth with teeth, tail swishing madly, eyes burning. She squashes me
without even turning the page. I am already nothing.</p>
<p>To her?</p>
<p>To whom I am it all?</p>
<p>It makes no sense except to say that I metaphoreally mean it. I felt,
when I thought something like that yesterday, whilst out — and stout —
in the fields — and feels — and in the flow. Working and being worked.
Call that thought, which is more like an uncertain something inside
action, in the doing itself. And call this feeling, these key-stroked
words preserved for all eternity (so long as we really are as immortal
as we cannot bear to feel)… preserved for all eternity to be eternally
analysed and shuffled, decomposed and puzzled, strange fizzing lichen
meanings behind these signs… these signs we see so all the time that we
barely recognise them.</p>
<p>Imagine this whole place mapped. Go out and walk about and instead of
the world see grass grass grass tree tree tree sun sun cloud gnat bird
post. That should be enough to convince you it isn’t like that. These
words are not labels. They are just like leaves on something as living
as the trees themselves. Not even these signs, these letters, sounds,
definitions, symbols… whatever we think we are seeing here, if it isn’t
ourselves, it is but a seeming thing.</p>
<p>Do you seem? Do you seem to be? Seem to be doing something?</p>
<p>Then you are a seeming thing, too.</p>
<p>That’s fine, we need every word we can find, and even those we
cannot, to write these stories.</p>
<p>May every seat be throne.</p>

<hr />

<p>It is not time, I want to be able to stand the test of. It is more
like a kind of weather.</p>
<p>You annoy me sometimes. It is not just me who annoys myself.</p>
<p>I don’t like it when you try to convince people of things. It is
wrong. It is incorrect to be right like that. There is nothing wrong
with being accurate, in itself. Nothing wrong with being specific, being
on point, being careful. But you have to realize that even this, even
what seems to you the oh so sensible — <em>what could be more evident
than self-evidence? I’m just pointing to it, and to what it is not, of
course, in order to be certain that we are both on the same page, both
behind the same cursor…</em> it is ridiculous. I’m sorry if you haven’t
been hit by this yet: it is not just the absurd that is absurd.</p>
<p>Is that even the meaning of absurdity?</p>
<p>Is that not, I mean.</p>
<p>I still think, feel, things have meaning, clearly, it is just that I
metaphoreally mean that ultimeltly all such meaning is the one. Let’s
not even say The One. Unless…</p>
<p>we metaphoreally mean it?</p>
<p>It just struck me, is all, yesterday, in the flow of things, it just
struck me that that was the perfect usage of ‘my’ term: the metaphoreal.
It is a form of… a kind of, rather… emphasis. Obviously this is part of
the problem with it. One of the reasons I annoy myself. Unless I’m doing
that just to teach myself a lesson.</p>
<p>I can only love myself, wholly. I cannot love this bit and not love
some other part. But I can and do like, and dislike, different ‘bits’ of
me to varying degrees. The emphasis I intend is of this order.</p>
<p>Can you see how it is Chaos?</p>
<p>She, your true nature? That it is her true nature because…</p>
<p>Because it was, is, and will be.</p>
<p>It is also Creativity. It is ‘because’ of this creativity — human,
say, if that’s what you think artists are — that the idea of Creation is
a… metaphoreality. But it is circular. Or circulating… we can only be
creative because this world is Creation. I cannot say what that means.
It is the one meaning, but it is story, not reality. Truth is
<em>about</em> this, in fact. Oh what a not, what a whole other kettle
of fish way to go and stink myself out with my own filthy fart breaths.
Stop fumbling over the words of a life’s work and have some fucking
sense about your sense of senses.</p>
<p>Do they have any idea what they really mean, when they say show and
don’t tell?</p>
<p>I don’t want to be convinced of anything. I am not trying to convince
you of anything. My ideas are not really concepts, and perhaps this is
all it means to be an artist. Surely Deleuze knew this, was saying this,
we have already penetrated each other and I can just get on with reading
fantasy books spiced up with the odd foray into some neuroscience or
quantum phuzzzxxx…</p>
<p>It just seems to me.</p>
<p>It seems to me more like it is all art, or would be better off
being.</p>
<p>How can I be any more way off than in saying this?</p>
<p>Why haven’t I changed course already?</p>
<p>Are all these knots just the echoes of unwritable thoughts?</p>
<p>You might catch a snippet of language on the edge of waking up. You
will be able to see the indeterminacy in it. That you were thinking, or
thought you were thinking, a suggestion of sorts. It will seem — it will
be — as if… haha, as if… as if there were many ways to say it. Yes,
there are. This is not possibility. This is not something you need to
clarify. You were thinking the suggestion directly. It was correct,
precise, in all its suggestivity. All those apparent ambiguities: its
truth.</p>
<p>Nothing radical here, in saying this. It is a kind of confusion
though. There is confusion in it. I have no idea why I struggle to relax
about that. I am clearly more like you than I realize. The confusion
most of us think of when we think of confusion, is not that kind. If we
try to have clarity about… about those suggestions, say… if we
<em>try</em>… then we come to the standard definition of confusion.</p>
<p>We need to partner up. Science and art. But you need to see how so
far you have always had it on your terms.</p>
<p>I am a kind of blind, I admit it. I had wanted to admit it already, I
forget precisely where or when, perhaps I did. Anyway, I do know I am
being ignorant in some ways. This is the wrong time to get into this. I
am meant to be pointing out <em>your</em> blindness.</p>
<p>It is not that the modern art-being-science’s-bitch stuff is all bad.
I enjoy it, or have enjoyed some of it. It is just that right now I am
raging with it. I am angry about it, and so it might as well all be
shit. It is in a way. The way has something to do with lacking a certain
ingredient.</p>
<p>(Good, I’ve just realized that this will be me perfectly
demonstrating my ignorance — we’ll be even.)</p>
<p>I can say what it lacks by saying what it is: it is a representation.
It is your theory, designed as an experience. It is just a container for
or translation of… a model of your model. For me this is the
anti-metaphor. It is analogy.</p>
<p>It is traditionally assumed that metaphor is a kind of analogy. It is
not, for me. These are the kinds of reversals or eversions that
particularly interest me: alterations in the orderings of just what is a
kind of what. This is what I understand as deconstruction.</p>
<p>How long is art going to be somebody’s bitch for?</p>
<p>I do understand, to some degree, that modernism is… one way to read
this is a first wobbly step into the freedom of our own two feet, and
this is why it is rife with what to me look like… echoes of pathologies.
Maybe in some ways or for some it was a foot put wrong. What a trip the
whole thing is.</p>
<p>Literally though. Metaphoreally.</p>
<p><em>We must go to great lengths in order to make it absolutely clear
that we are not undermining the idea of reality here. A world we share.
An intersobjectov trooof…</em></p>
<p>Do you think that that is what is happening? That is the problem with
the world is it? And the answer?</p>
<p>It would be so convenient just to assume we must each already
understand what the other means.</p>
<p>Let me try to breathe, soften a bit. Lent is coming and coffee will
be out the window then, perhaps that will help. I’ll just be reading
sutras in the day and fantasy stories before bed. That will help.</p>
<p>If that, what you lot, your sort, are saying, was an object, or even
any kind of thing, by which I mean: even a fiction, a character, some
particular book, a religion, a concept, a movement, a theory, a
question… if it was. What was I going to say? What would I have done, if
it was something like that? Pointed to it, of course, and then what?
Just said… not that?</p>
<p>Perhaps.</p>
<p>The moon rose. It seemed just the colour of the sun. I doubt it was.
I could never imagine seeing something I can imagine is a hare, on the
sun. But I can see the hare burning with light. Yes indeed. Yes, in
fact.</p>
<p>It probably seemed so close to the sun because of the black of the
sky behind. And between. And beyond.</p>
<p>Something to do with the contrast, I mean. That black that much the
blacker than that blue, that pink orange glow that much the duller than
that pink orange glow, and so appearing approximately equal.</p>
<p>No, no approximately. That would be a redundancy. And it would only
have been dancingly redundant were I to have said
approximat<em>iv</em>ely.</p>
<p>Regardless, it was like watching the perfect reverse of a sun rise or
set.</p>
<p>Rise.</p>
<p>The Moon Rose.</p>
<p>She Rose.</p>
<p>Heroes.</p>
<p>Time’s arrow</p>
<p>becomes arrows. Arose.</p>
<p>It is not time I wish to stand the tests of.</p>
<p>Not those kinds of tests either: formal ones.</p>
<p>I do not wish to train myself on some kind of obstacle course.</p>
<p>What if it were all just the absence of a walk?</p>
<p>Would you think me a fascist, then?</p>
<p>If I told you you just need to get out more?</p>
<p>How about if I meant, if what I meant to say was…</p>
<p>Would you like to go for a walk with me?</p>
<p>I mean, that’s what this is, really.</p>
<p>It won’t be <em>you</em> will it, who will ever convince anyone of
anything.</p>
<p>Who convinced you?</p>
<p>Was it you? Was it me? Did I convince myself?</p>
<p>Should I ever settle for the ways in which such questions can be
answered yes and no? That particular kind of yes and no which is a
tangle of non-conflictions? Is that <em>should</em> the same kind of
should as you should do this — that, sorry — you should do… that?
Awkward, isn’t it.</p>
<p>I think it is.</p>
<p>Like uneven ground though.</p>
<p>Not like bad shoes.</p>
<p>It is a matter of taste, that I don’t have tattoos.</p>
<p>No, it’s not. It is something that happened to me, which became a
decision I made. I do enjoy them on other people. I appreciate the art
and culture of it. But they’re not for me. Deeply and yet without
distaste. It has nothing to do with taste.</p>
<p>It always has something to do with trauma, and so has nothing to do
with that, either.</p>
<p>I know that when I ask: What is it that art proves?</p>
<p>No one will try to say that it seeks to prove a point of sorts. No
one thinks that.</p>
<p>So it isn’t that I think that science art becomes a way to prove a
point. I’m not saying that.</p>
<p>I like those kinds of installations. I like walking among the
pointless things. I myself am useless.</p>
<p>More so than this is?</p>
<p>That would be the case if… something fantastic. Something absolutely
fantastic. Genius.</p>
<p>But wouldn’t you have to be, or have been, a genius for that to occur
to you?</p>
<p>Isn’t it just madness, to be able to see some scale of useless in
which the more useless things get the better they are? The more
Good?</p>
<p>It’s not is it?</p>
<p>But it’s not a urinal in an art gallery either is it? Not any
more.</p>
<p>Obviously it never was, and that was the point.</p>
<p>You can smoke my pipe, but not suck my cock, that isn’t why I brought
you to the wilderness, not this time baby.</p>
<p>Sorry, they’ll be times I’m sorry I wrote that. One day I’ll just
stop myself from saying that kind of stuff, or edit it out if I say it
anyway. But this is my diary you are reading. The Winding Brook Diaries,
One. Or more like a comic book would, up in the corner: Winding Brook
Diaries #1.</p>
<p>Winter 2022.</p>
<p>Yep, it’s still that, even though it is Spring and 2023.</p>
<p>Realities have this way of overlapping.</p>
<p>Doesn’t mean there is one.</p>
<p>Ceci ce n’est pas une pipe. Did I say that was the point? That’s the
problem with that kind of stuff. It is not what I imagine science art
currently suffers from.</p>
<p>It would probably just be like the standard critique of, which is
only really a dislike of, allegory.</p>
<p>May every seat be throne.</p>

<hr />

<p>Right, I’ve rubbed some heat into my hands but don’t be surprised if
you feel me shivering.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what I think that is, a dislike for allegory, what
that is about. That is about not liking it when every element in a story
or text or whatever is designed to tell you something, designed to
represent something. Here, the old man character is speaking, so the
author is saying something about wisdom or age. That’s a boring but
straightforward example.</p>
<p>I started reading Dante’s Divine Comedy, because of something I said
to myself when I was high, mostly. Then stopped again. Maybe it really
was all in the title? That’s what I was trying to tell myself?</p>
<p>Dante just called it his Comedy, apparently. The Divine got added
later. Of course it is, anyway.</p>
<p>Anyway, that is meant to be an allegory. So have a look at that if
you want an example, or if I need to give a better one. I’m not sure if
it is an allegory really. The translator thinks it is one. I mostly
stopped reading because I can’t read Italian, I think. Maybe that is why
they sent me a tin of fart tomatoes?</p>
<p>I’ll probably try again some day, with a different translation
maybe.</p>
<p>Anyway, that is a great book. A wonderful poem. That was coming
through, even to me, and despite it being an allegory. I’m quite sure it
doesn’t reduce to that, and perhaps that is all that dislike is about:
it is a distaste for the idea that a work of art can boil down to
something like that. A bunch of meanings, so-called, that the artist is
attempting to convey. Hold that together with the absolute certainty
that Dante has a system, and then you’re on to it.</p>
<p>Clearly we are not so far apart, science and art, or thought and
feeling or you and I or whatever we are.</p>
<p>We both don’t want to be anybody’s bitch. I can’t think of a better
way to say it. This is feminism isn’t it? This is what you gals
mean?</p>
<p>So let’s team the fuck up in service of <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>I’m not going to sniff your fucking bum anymore, science dog.</p>
<p>And you can just get your nose the fuck out my crotch.</p>
<p>Simples. Sorted. Sayed it.</p>
<p>Sss.</p>
<p>I am a snake, clearly. I have a forked tongue. I am a very naughty
boy. You’ve seen what they do to people like me. What we do to
ourselves.</p>
<p>I am the devil.</p>
<p>But aren’t you meant to be Prometheus or something?</p>
<p>You do know we are the same fucking god, right?</p>
<p>And we’ve got to be somebody’s bitch, too, you get that don’t
you?</p>
<p>I mean you can kind of see how that could work? Maybe not.</p>
<p>This is why I am going to never forget my wife. Worship her in some
kind of gentle normal way that won’t attract the attention of any
supposéd authorities. Look, I even marked the accent on that e.</p>
<p>She is a thoroughly decent human being.</p>
<p>I mean, she’s a wreck, as well, but that’s what I mean.</p>
<p>She’s a wreck, but me</p>
<p>I’m a ruin.</p>
<p>I’m a very naughty boy.</p>
<p>You need me on your team.</p>
<p>But here I am. Last to be picked again.</p>
<p>No, wait, hang on a minute, look at that geeky fella. Is it a fella?
I didn’t even notice them.</p>
<p>Hey girl, I don’t feel like playing their games anymore, you want to
go skip stones?</p>
