<h1>January 15th, 2023</h1>
<h2>08:49 Winding Brook</h2>

<p>As I came back from the farm yesterday, having gone to get our supply
of raw milk in, she looked up from raking the hay off the path with
that fake smile grimace of hers and I shot it back to her, two wet pink
skull faces sharing an unfunny joke, she said: “I think all that holiday
did was to make me hate your family.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” said I, quietly reactive in my own still swirling emotional
turbulence, “there weren’t any moments of beauty? Come in when you are
ready for lunch.”</p>
<p>I didn’t want to face into this dark corner and munch, didn’t want
anything to watch or read, no screen. I turned my chair toward the table
and looked out through Salvia Divinorum’s forlorn winter display at the
blue-grey cast of the yard, and I brooded. It was noted that I actually
thought about killing her at one point. My, my, I thought, you really
must love her if you’d sooner kill her than simply go your own way. I
entertained, then, the idea of leaving both her and my family, perhaps
searching out my brothers the monks.</p>
<p>Yes, it had been a difficult week. Gloriously so, really. A very rich
experience. Hopefully for everyone. But I had been pulled very strongly
in two opposed directions. I was exhausted and it would take me some
time to settle back down. So just eat, man, look out the window and try
not to kill anyone or alter the path of your life too drastically, for
the minute at least.</p>
<p>I was flipping back to feeling the love for my family after having
hardened against them. I had been justly and playfully critical for the
most part, just keeping her and I entertained. But they had upset me,
too, and at times I had given full voice to this — into her ear only — and
now I was feeling bad about it, reflecting back on my own failings,
experiencing the horror of my own harsh judgements stripping away the
value from my person and leaving only a sorry, lacking husk. The pointed
fingers of selfishness must be shaped something like the Corona
Virus.</p>
<p>“It has well dark vibes, doesn’t it?” My brother-in-law had said at
one point. I told him I didn’t think so, and that I quite liked it over
all. It is quite a balanced virus. And so, I suppose, is selfishness, so
long as the finger is always pointing back the way it came, which
of course is easier said than done. As a person who is naturally on the
quiet side, who has lived with a family who are anything but, and who
experiences the human family most generally as being on this “noisier” side of
things, I will say that the finger of selfishness has a tendency to
point one way only. It would be quite a radical realization for most
folk to see their sociability, their care for those around them, that
which they tend to conceive as unselfishness itself: their very
generosity, as an imposition.</p>
<p>How strange, it strikes me now, that the farm was called Charity and that
the theme I now discover haunting me is Selfishness. How
appropriate.</p>
<p>It is a bitter thing to sound, this idea. But I am drinking coffee,
whose bitterness is a strong component of its goodness, and feel
comforted by this. It took me a long time even to glimpse it. A long time and a drastic
change in my way of life: a move into the dream of living closer to
nature, more economically and self-sufficiently — more caringly, as I
understand and experience it — more honestly, really, even as this ‘good life’ can itself appear
as just another symptom of the pervasive madness of today. But then it
would, wouldn’t it? In the end times, throughout the great collapse, the
criteria for the verification of the healthiness of ones way would
itself be akin to a great neither rhetorical nor non-rhetorical question
mark over absolutely everything.</p>
<p>Including everything, and the absolute, and nature, naturally… but
how does one really question the question? Might that question, which is
a genuine one, point not to the recursive hell it could seem to, or not
to an <em>empty</em> absurdity, but to a fuller one, in which, say, the
question comes before the question, and this corresponds to a kind of
knowing, or state of consciousness, which is somehow
immediately reflective. As if, instead of being a being looking into a
mirror and seeing an image of itself bounce back, ones mind was a mirror
of every sense, and this sense of senses was the Real Imagination, and
was not thus a sense of senses as in a sensing of senses but a higher
sense from which said senses derive any sense they might have. To look
in this mirror, which is the mirror of meaning itself, which is prior to
spacetime and is part of the key to the mystery of their unity, and yet
their incommensurability, for they are senses too — to ‘look’, to ‘see’,
‘in’ this mirror — is to divide what cannot be further divided, that
which cannot be split, which is the root of the meaning of the
individual, this atomic, radical subjectivity which we take to be a
characteristic of modernity. The sense of senses, the imagination, is
like looking into a mirror in which there are two real lookers, and
between them neither no difference nor any sameness. The closest we get is
a totalized similitude that some take for simulation, the hotbed of
meaning, being being itself as ever-becoming — and this finding its
paradoxical irreconciliation in this-that infinite which cannot be ‘an
infinity’ (as, for instance, a mathematical infinity can). Totalized
similitude, and this itself being alienation, or the peak or pinnacle of
it, which is also its annihilation: no family, no friends even, but no
enemies either. All our relations. The Metaphoreal. Two human faces
facing each other, staring into, and out of, and through and beyond each
other, as their identities shift and dance. This real and available
experience is a good picture of this Chaosmic Mirror, but not by itself.
It has to be held together with the experience of, or the image of, one
person alone with a literal mirror. It has to be just as seeable in the
great eye at the other end of a microscope looking at the tiny lifeforms
of the normally invisible. Or even in the space, so-called, between the
leaves of the tree, that same tree we would wonder at the sound of,
should it fall.</p>
<p>None of this is still, but nor is it moving. As they say: the cherry
blossom and the stars in the night sky are each as good a picture of the
eternal. Nothing of this is simple, but nor is it really that complex.
In truth, it has to be without complication, and this cannot be
simplified. None of this is without feeling, without heart, without
hurt, without beauty, without music, without art. None of this is not a
science. None of this is over emotional, none of this is getting carried
away. And yet none of this is total. It cries, and it laughs, and it
sings. Soothes and stings. We get the picture, how can we not?</p>
<p>And yet we don’t. We all experience depression. Most all of us, I
guess. And yet we can forget how a difference in kind can come about
from just a drop of infinity in this world of potentially countable
degrees. Digressions.</p>
<p>We are sad, we find it hard to get out of bed, to make contact with
others, with ourselves, with life. But the moment we extrapolate from
that to imagine that we understand a depressed person… well, either we
do or we don’t. We don’t understand them if we were able to get out of
bed, to go for that walk, to snap ourselves out of it, to keep on
keeping on — we don’t understand them if we imagine because we did this,
that that is the answer for them, or even a possibility.</p>
<p>And yet we must not give up on the hopes of their getting better. We
do not unmisunderstand them simply by becoming totally and truly
depressed ourselves. The differences between Yes, No, and Wait, become
ever more apparent, and the complete lack of Maybe begins to
rehabilitate itself as the Truth again, without allowing a certain
certainty to get a hold.</p>
<p>Get a grip!</p>
<p>We all have need of quiet moments, of time alone, of our own space.
Does this mean we can simply comprehend someone whose life, or at least
health, sanity, deeply depends upon it?</p>
<p>Not necessarily.</p>
<p>Messy celery. Yessy, see el, seal, seallery. Sea. Soul. Saw.
Soar…</p>
<p>Is there something in the water? Something more than the hill? Less
than the uses we find for not yet ancient mistakes we did not make?</p>
<p>Something in the waterfall that deeply depends upon not being
dependent upon us. It is not for us to put each other in our places the
way that does.</p>
<p>Not so much where was I, as where was it I wanted to go? It seemed
just around the corner, and now it is buried deeper than something that
never was.</p>
<p>Who could bury the heart of the earth?</p>
<p>Perhaps it was this. Yes, this: the idea of healing. And then that:
the value of rage. The joke that is not a joke that is <em>about</em> as well as
being <em>just what</em> makes the flowers grow.</p>
<p>“Makes the flowers grow”. You put that in quotes to show you know
that nothing can make what they are making themselves, what they must be
making. Nothing else can make it, and yet they do not own it, do not
possess it, do not generate it themselves. It is more akin to how
something feels. We make how it feels, and yet unless that is how it
feels we cannot make it so. We can say we bring it out, soften vitalism
into new phorms of emergence, but it is all making. Making it remains.
Poetry. Creation.</p>
<p>There can be no isming this phorm of Creation. This much should be
clear. However, I personally shall state that it is not necessarily not
what a Real Believer might be talking about, or around about.</p>
<p>But I was going to say something about healing first. As distinct,
perhaps, from Haleness. For my wife is hale and hearty, and this is as
clear as that some would still like to heal her.</p>
<p>And now I feel the spectre of physical health, which is not what I
want to mean by Hale. I should not have said Hearty, perhaps. I am
talking about Wholeness, specifically as it might be said to manifest as
character or inner strength. For me it does not equal, and can even
distinguish itself against, the idea of being well-integrated. Its
appearance — the appearance of Wholeness — need not be balanced. Beauty
need not be pretty. In fact, for me at least, it is necessarily not.
Wholeness is not the same as being complete, but nor can one who is
whole — who is Just Being themself — be said to be incomplete.
Unfinished, sure, I like that. More.</p>
<p>I don’t want to conjure the spectre of physical health, and yet it is
in the wilds that I feel this feeling most. And that is naturally harder
for the differently abled to access. Forgive me for not trying to think
of everyone, and just letting myself speak for myself and say what I
need to based on the experiences I have recently been through, based on
the being I am and according to the infinity of this
particuliarity.</p>
<p>There is a way I laugh that is almost literally a dangerous wind. A
wind that would kill me, a wind I could not weather. I laugh, but not
without that wind, and to such a degree that that wind laughs through
me. Not everyone does. That wind is grim, and a moment later my face
will show you I understand this. But still I laugh. I suppose it is not
even I, quite honestly.</p>
<p>That wind is a way I know I am facing Thee Wylds. Even as I
now realize the most recent time it made me laugh I had it at my back.
Whether one laughs or no that wind is a herald, an angel, of the wild.
That Wild that particuliarises as Thee Wylds for me. Or will.</p>
<p>Will. Is. So here is another becoming. I see it surfacing. I know it
is surfacing in my world, still rearranging my grains, patterning my
poetic iron filings, as it enters my world more profoundly. Protrudes
more profoundly. It is becoming and yet without ever not being what it
is. It is becoming for me, in my work, in time — but it is this very
process, this very verbality, by which I name it and know it as a noun,
as a being, something that is not changing, that does not
really change, that thus is eternal in a way that very much need not
last forever — that has nothing to do with <em>all time</em>, perhaps
precisely in the way in which the infinite need have nothing to do with
<em>everything</em>, and yet, I acknowledge, cannot really be thought — <em>thought,</em>
at least — apart from said concept. Thus is All not the same as Whole,
for me. Infinity might be useful in making certain sums, be the product
or root of some, but it is not itself a sum, and is quite obviously both
the presence and absence of The Sum.</p>

<h2>11:28</h2>

<p>I have just returned from a little break. Poo. Feeding the birds.
Getting some firewood in, lighting it.</p>
<p>“A generalization is a generalization.” It came back to me that this
was another one of my favourite tautologies, which I wanted to discover
in order to pair them up with, or to complement at least, my favourite
contradictions… no, hang on a minute, I had my favourite tautologies
already — it was the contradictions I imagined I was after! I expect
these things are neither. Perhaps they are formally a kind of neither
nor, that looks a little like a both or many. Maybe they are simply
puns. Clearly I’m not sure yet.</p>
<p>It has been a good discourse, this little break. Filled with coherent
thought. Expanding upon the already written with a bunch of what is not
to be, at least not exactly. Increasingly I am happy enough with this,
knowing that the thoughts I am having lead off and return to what I
have written, and so are there for others to find if they truly find
themselves along for the ride.</p>
<p>One of the thoughts concerns the What Is of Philosophy, which is to
say it recognises that philosophy is indeed going on here. I am not a
philosopher, and this is not philosophy — it is also not
‘non-philosophy’! — but it is not pseudo-philosophy, just as it is not
pure philosophy.</p>
<p>It is also impure poetry and not yet particularly accomplished
prose. But it <em>is</em> poetry, mostly, for me. Even if it only achieves such
momentarily and is certainly not literally always poetry: broadly
speaking, or in general, my project is poetry and I am a poet. That is
what I think I feel I know.</p>
<p>And we are all interesting bedfellows. Poetry, philosophy, theology.
Metaphysics, maths, theoretical physics. Whatever it is we practise,
there is some kind of overlap. Even precisely in those differences, the
places we repell each other. There are forces between us which no
discipline, nor meta-discipline, nor indiscipline (clearly!) can own,
explicate, or take care of.</p>
<p>But it was of philosophy that I was thinking, and of poetry.
How we share a certain ‘is-not-there-ness’ in the sense that we each
require a certain effort to be made, a certain something to be brought
to the table, before we are able to reveal what we are or are made of.
And without this, this something that sometimes even philosophers and
poets ourselves find ourselves unable to bring to the table (knock
knock) our activities are worse than empty: they are the devastation of
themselves. The not-what-they-seemed-to-be, and yet not in a surprising,
revelatory fashion, in the dreaded sense of their not-even-opposites.
Their simple not-themselves alone. Vacant, wasted. Failed.</p>
<p>The popular view of philosophy as a form of pedantry would then
roughly approximate the view of poetry as inherently exaggerated. Such
views are both ignorant and true. They are partial, and as close as some
ever need to come, for it is true that going beyond such is rather a lot
of work, and that it is only in putting in this work that one really opens
themselves to the pain of the waste of it, as well as the almost
invisible joys of the accomplishment.</p>
<p>So, there we are, we can be ignorant without even trying! Maybe this
is even exactly what ignorance is? I had thought it would be the better
kind of ignorance, and that there would be a worse kind, a kind of
active ignorance, but I guess we just call this intolerance and be done
with it? I wonder if that implies that we somehow consider tolerance an
almost effortless thing? Do we consider tolerance to be natural?</p>
<p>I suppose that certain materials have structural tolerances and that we
consider these innate to the materials as well as being properties of
the ways we shape them. So there <em>is</em> a kind of natural tolerance, even
shown here in quite a literal fashion. But the idea is I suppose not
dissimilar to the notion that the human is inherently good. Sickness /
intolerance / active ignorance is a product of stresses upon the proper
functioning of the system. But then, the system is itself the product of
this. Without some kind of stress, we wouldn’t even have ‘functioning’.
The experience of this as the very way it is must be akin to a kind of
healthiness which exists without the curing of any of its more locally
supposéd ills. What else can perfection mean? What a beautiful marriage
it makes of the organic and the machine! What a strange insight into the
nature of the divine!</p>
<p>What would it mean to replace all notions of progress with an
effortlessly fruitful… I digress.</p>
<p>I digress, grinningly, knowing the manyone jokings of poetry.</p>
<p>I turn it towards a pleasurable grimace, taste the bitter nature
goodness getting old in my unbrushed mouth and pluck this little piece
of anti-poetry out: effortlessly fruitful! What a foul, despicable
mouthful! It is rage that makes the flowers grow don’t forget!</p>
<p>Not a rage we have to produce ourselves, not a rage we can
necessarily inculcate, and surely Rage Without An Object… but to call a
force, even a force of nature (as if in the end there could be any
other) <em>effortless…</em></p>
<p>Fuck off!</p>

<hr />

<p>Before I come back to this I want to continue mining my digression:
The discourse of the interruption. I wonder if one day I will get to the
level where I can perform a kind of antidote to Coleridge’s Stranger
From Porlock (in which the reverie that remains Kubla Kahn was broken,
and presumably cut short, by a knock at the door, whereupon the brown storm
river of the outside world suddenly and catastrophically mingled with
the still black water of his opium-warmed alone) ? Will I one day write
the poetry of the interruption itself ? It is a poetic idea, at least,
for you tell me what it means !</p>
<p>Quite literally: some time before I first stopped, my wife opened up
from the howl outside to drop off some salad for the perfect thing and
asked me if I was ready to go to the garden centre with her. I wondered
if she might not go alone for I was busy unloading some heavy buzzy
daze of emotion-crazed unwriting and could not be counted on to be
properly useful today (which is, after all, a Sunday). She went off
planting Alder and said she would check back later.</p>
<p>The Alder in Wales, or in that place in between England and Wales, are
strikingly winding, almost like Oaks. The ones we are more familiar with
have a taller, straighter, more triangular or pinnacular aspect. We
wondered whether it was the weather or some local genetic variation.
Perhaps it could be both. We talked about planting some on their own here at home, or
at least with a little more space to grow, to express what might be
another side of their nature. I wonder if that has anything to do with
why she is down there planting them today?</p>
<p>(It didn’t, I asked her later, they were left over from before the
holiday, sat in a puddle waiting to find a place between some cypresses I had
planted.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I came across her after having my poo and feeding the birds
and she asked me again about going out and I restated that only my
unreliability was reliable today. One of the ways we work very well
together is in being able to hold well enough apart like this. Although
we notice it, too, if it goes on too long or becomes one-sided.
Sometimes I will go deep into my work for long enough that most would
imagine something is wrong with me — especially when the work doesn’t
magically manifest as any kind of object — she doesn’t do that but she
has wondered, before, if something is wrong with us, and I have noted
that perhaps I am a little lost, and indeed we have then benefitted from
being a little more present for each other.</p>
<p>I joked a few times, after one particularly epic walk, that I had
found it best just to Listen To The Wife. She would suggest that I put
on another layer, for example, though I would not currently need it and so
would impulsively say no — but after a while I began to notice that she was
basically always right. Just Listen To The Wife.</p>
<p>There are helpful concerned suggestions and then there are the
strange schemes of twistedly indirect interventions and I very well
know which I prefer. Calculating the best interests of one who might
better be left well enough alone is a somewhat inevitable doom.</p>
<p>While she was off planting the Alder she had misplaced the second Rumex Tool. The first being one of those
mysterious missing persons. Fairy-snatched. A changling returned in its
place: an old spade. You could accomplish Rumex Tool work with a spade,
sure, but every step would make you wish for that solid two-pronged
fork.</p>
<p>I was crossing the yard with an empty wood tray, on my way to fill it
up, and she passed me again with an emphatic shrug. I broadcast Sorry
Love with a hurried smile. I imagined it was a good example. No, first I
thought: Well, that might teach her the value of returning the tools to
a consistent location, no matter how tired she is or how soon the job
insists it will be picked back up. It is thus a bit of a
dick-flavoured example. I expect they need not all be but to me there
is something inherently a little dickish seeming to this style of
non-intervention. Likely it only really makes sense interspersed with
those times I have helped her to look for these tools or else needed them
myself and had to go hunting for them, expressing my loving dismay at what a
waste of time it was and how simply it could have been prevented. And
then done the exact same thing myself, left old Mjulnir in the long grass by
some frantically inserted post.</p>
<p>The idea is that only by repeatedly searching for something one has
misplaced does one really realize the value in the arse pain of
carrying it home every time.</p>
<p>No: the real idea is that we really can rob each other of important
realizations through acts of kindness. By helping, we can make things
worse, or perhaps even worse: make things neither better nor worse.</p>
<p>It is not such a startling or uncommon idea, I suppose, but I’m not
sure it is such an easy one to apply. It has not been easy for me to
realize the ways in which people being kind to me in my life might not
have been in my own best interests. (Or in other words: Dad was right.
(Even though, to be honest, he probably wasn’t. (Or at least: didn’t have
to be such a dick about it.)))</p>
<p>Other examples I can think of, specifically and materially related to
me: Jane Fonda Honda Wonda Car. I loved that car and it was much safer
than the one I myself could have afforded (and did in fact want) but it
wasn’t really me. Who knows how many experiences and adventures it
robbed me of? Death on the side of a busy motorway, you say? Quite
possibly, quite possibly… I am not saying I don’t understand or that I
am any better or would have done things differently. But nor can I not
be saying that, so best just to get on and say stuff and leave other
minds to their own make ups.</p>
<p>This computer is another example. The handed-down Macbook was deeply
appreciated and was a great computer but it was not me, not the way
this little Thinkbook with Linux on is. Plus it wasn’t universally
agreed that I ‘deserved’ that computer… but now I risk
pettiness when I was just trying to give some concrete examples. Likely
not very good ones and potentially even counter-productive — but this
kind of doubt recording is surely as boring to read as it is to
produce.</p>
<p>The real worry with saying this kind of stuff, which is itself
predicated on the embarrassing assumption that ones words will be read
by anyone, and have any kind of force even if they are — of course I know
that words can exert a kind of force, but not these kind of words, and not in that kind of a way —
why then I am putting this ignorance on display? Perhaps I imagine that
reading it back later will learn me? Likely I am just running out of
energy, and what I really have to learn concerns this.</p>
<p>It is one thing to go out walking and find after a while that one is
so well adapted to doing so that it might after all be even easier than
standing still, it is another thing to waffle into ones log because in
this case likely the harder thing to do is to stop, take a break, or for
a moment</p>
<p>just shut up.</p>

<hr />

<p>What a horrible world it would be, were one never interrupted.</p>
<p>How different it is, to be alone in that sense that is not against
togetherness. Yet how dangerous it seems to me to push back against
so-called individuality because of a few headstrong (and likely
heartwronged) crowds of one who simply cannot Get With The Plan.</p>
<p>Because, let’s face it, there isn’t and never will be one. And so
what else can the world ever be up to?</p>
<p>It takes work, not to be ignorant. I suppose that in beginning to
realize this we are on the path and at the same time we can grant that
the truly ignorant are also (fairly?) innocent ?</p>
<p>We all know, or I guess have heard of, the Socratean wisdom that
only in knowing how much we don’t do we begin to become at all wise… but
have we really applied it in our lives if the ignorance we see is
mostly always someone else’s? Who is educating who about whom? A humma humma
what now?</p>
<p>And so here is the whole depthless mountain of my own collection of
molehills. And, as I write the trace of my surveying that, I promise you
lightning strikes over my shoulder, as if someone taking a photo of me
through the window, and as I wonder if perhaps that is just what it
weirdly was, the thunder growls Not.</p>
<p>I know you are not trying to fix her. At least I will give you the
benefit of the doubt when you say that — even though I think I have to
doubt it, as well, in order to be able to give you the benefit of
it.</p>
<p>I know you were trying to help me, you did help me, or have, even in
those ways that you didn’t. But you are not simply selfless. You are not
unselfish, even in the way you give. Our ignorance is as profound as or
perhaps even greater than or more worryingly perhaps: proportional to
our knowledge or wisdom or consciousness.</p>
<p>One little glimpse of my own mountainous molehill is enough to
remind me of the infinite floating weight of this finite tip of the
iceberg I seem to see that I see. How about you? Is it wrong of me to
feel the need to give speech to such unownable undertow?</p>
<p>It is the wrongness of the artist, perhaps. An art that cannot be
utilized therapeutically yet is far from being but vented suffering. An
art that must sometimes seem a symptom and will ever appear as such to
some. But… what? What is the wind that wants to carry you away to say…
something about it being as realized an other as the self is that views
it. “Views it”. It seems quite apart from Beauty, all this. And Beauty
is what Art Really Is. That is when it doesn’t matter if we like it.
That is when we know we have made it, or when it has made itself, and us
in the process. But then Art would only be masterpieces. And if not,
Beauty would only be in the eye of the beholder and Art would be for
the Angels alone to see.</p>
<p>But that’s it, isn’t it? Do you remember?</p>
<p>Remember thinking of Blake saying that was who he wrote for, or that
was the moment he knew his work was complete: not in the printing and
publication: in the laughter and joy of the Angels who were reading over
his shoulder: in the moment of Creation itself and in the quivering
wake that is not not it.</p>
<p>Remember thinking <em>that</em> only because you were thinking something else,
having some insight into the why that you write, one of those thoughts
that will seem to betray a certain inflation if you share it, but in
truth points to anything but.</p>
<p>It was just that the birds seemed to be saying Thank You again,
probably. That their sweet little songs seemed an answer to yours, and
without this unbecoming a question. And that it wasn’t even Thank You
for feeding us, but for the seeding of this speaking for us. I know you
do not presume to say what we are, to be something so tragically
misguided as the sole author of our voice. I know you know how
widespread this attempt to make us heard is, to make you hear that you
hear us, and how failingly unfailingly semi-successful that it is, that
it must, by its nature, by our natures, be. But you get it, Thank You,
and so will they, now you are getting them more. Now you understand you
can speak for us, you do speak for us, in speaking to and for them. For
them that are you, which is to say like you. To them who are unlike you,
which is to say like you. That we are indeed more like you, which is to
say unlike you, which might even be to say like them. Strange, isn’t
it?</p>
<p>Just be careful it doesn’t become a fashion to say… I’m not
trying to fix you, her, me, them… but. But? Whether you say it or not,
the but is there, hey? And not even the butt of the joke.</p>
<p>The broken healer. One of those things in which you say the same
thing twice without it quite becoming redundant. And so here is
the most horrible thing:</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I was going to put it there, and then it occurred to me there was a
parallel with art, not so much within art but within the relationship of
art to the world when it falls into patterns of production and consumption, which, I
wonder just now, might be as much what I am talking about as anything. That is: just because you have a
market, a currency, a machinery of exchange, it doesn’t mean that what
you are dealing with isn’t care, or shouldn’t be understood as such.
That the give and take of it all cannot be made pure, no matter how
abstracted it becomes, no matter how managed, mismanaged, womanaged, or
not managed it is.</p>
<p>It is better that the person who offers a service is acknowledged, by
themselves and by others, as benefitting from this service equally but
in a different way from those who they provide it to.</p>
<p>Better than them, us, or manyone else, confusing this with something
tokenistic, or conflating it with what then eclipses or fouls it. But I
am getting stranger and more abstruse. And the second lightning strike
has thunder bound closer to it in time. And I am hungrier than ever both
for food and good concrete meaning. Thirsty for clarity in myself. Am I
proposing some kind of solution? Is there one here? Or if there is not,
has this become a kind joyless masturbation, one without even the
mounted pleasure of delay.</p>
<p>Delay. Delight. And nothing to do with light, that. More like
delicious? Wasn’t it? Delicate, even? I can’t remember. The thunder is
my frown. Frowning for me.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I don’t know, perhaps I just mean I would rather live in a world in
which people cared impurely, than one in which they did not care at all,
but perhaps this is precisely and perfectly the problem, only in a way
we have to realize for ourselves, or else that I am somehow just too
stilted to show.</p>
<p>I obviously do not care purely. Perhaps I have done. Maybe it refers
only to those certain special sometimes, and is not meant as some kind
of, blerk, healing, or simple replacement for, our day-to-day attempts to
make things feel better or right, or whatever.</p>
<p>I wonder if what I am trying to do here isn’t that anyway. In a way
I am trying to not care, but in a sense that is neither careless nor,
exactly, against care.</p>
<p>It is clear enough to me how this whole slog can be seen a kind of
symptom, or what others might call a reaction. If it were a polished
piece I could say something clever about pieces of grit and pearls. As
it is, I wonder about ways to save people, or perhaps simply myself, the
bother of reading all this stuff by summarising it somehow. Maybe a kind
of introduction that says enough that it can say: and now there is no
need to read on. But if you imagine there was some kind of a need to
read this far, well, then perhaps you would make a good walking partner,
so by all means, let us stroll.</p>
<p>Sorry, the sun came out about half a moment ago.</p>
<p>Think of all the ways this crazy weather is not not our own. Do you
understand a bi-polar person because we all have our ups and our downs?
Or could this be a barrier to your understanding them? Or is it both.
Andor. This place, which it is useful to a point to be able to draw a
line or plant a hedge around. But usefulness only goes so far,
right?</p>
<p>Me I don’t have a diagnosis. I sometimes imagine I have had enough of
a taste of everything — even being a Black, Disabled, Gay Bitch — that I
more or less understand. Even more than you probably do, or think you
do, I mean. Then I tell myself I am as ridiculous and ignorant as anyone
else. I promise, I do, I mean it.</p>
<p>I also mean it when I say, or feel: I don’t need a diagnosis, I am a
gnostic, so I have my dire gnosis, or it has me, or she, or what have
ye.</p>
<p>We arrive home and it feels smaller and sparser than before, as if it
were true that all England is a garden. Yet she is pleased, I think, to
speak French again. She says she is just too exhausted to speak her now
habitual English. Her sexy Frenchy English. But I feel that somehow she
is seeing the world closer to how it really is.</p>
<p>Imperfect.</p>
<p>How many of us have really realized what it means for this Imperfection to be a quality of reality, and to such an
extent that it is more really a bearer of the real than objective
thingitude? You see what I mean. Or do I? Sorry, the sun just dipped
behind a cloud.</p>
<p>The power is still out. My writing session is thus inevitably timed.
It could come back on before I imagine that I am done, I guess. The
forlorn Salvia Divinorum is reflected on the right — my right — of
the screen — its left — dear out of place plant in its Winter Survival
Dress — and the little floating island for the birds — reflected over
the reflection of my shoulder — the little pitter patter of their
quickly scattered seed.</p>
<p>I figure that was just me working some energy out. What I said was
too close to being potent, somehow, so I kept on waffling. Or else it
wasn’t quite right and I was hoping this might get me closer to what it
was supposed to be.</p>
<p>That imperfection allows for that, and without that meaning to aim
for perfection. Perfection having something like nothing to do with aim,
at least as we normally conceive it, or seem to. Or aim having nothing
to do with use. The idea of confounded purposes, but not. Because then
we are just making awkward objects again, that might appeal to our
senseless senses of humour, but don’t really say what we want them to,
which is what we can’t, but are, only not in a way that not saying can
say, either.</p>
<p>We laughed, about making people fill out a questionnaire to visit our
garden. The Winding Brook Sanctuary for Ultraterrestrial Life. What is
your favourite book? Your favourite sound? Your favourite colour?</p>
<p>If you can’t read, you don’t have to worry about the first one. It’s
not really about the what of what you answer, anyway. We just kind of
hoped you liked to read, but we can just read each other, that’s
fine.</p>
<p>If you answer the second question, it is probably wrong. But it is
all a joke, insofar as it is anything but, so that’s alright.</p>
<p>(“Does he really want me to respond with if I am alright or not?” She
asked as we came back up the path from the waterfall. I had to explain
that “alright?” was just a more northern way of saying Good Day, and
that the formality of the southern Hello, or Good Morning, was probably
part of what felt a bit more uppity to them — too formal — but that also
it wasn’t that he really wanted to know if you were alright, and that in
fact it was expected <em>not</em> for you to be very well, thank you, but rather simply Not
So Bad. You realize the value in maintaining a formal way of speaking to
unfamiliar people, or at least I do, when you spend any time with either
French or else High Functioning Autistic people, or both.)</p>
<p>The third question is just a friendly and funny way for us to be able
to tell you to fuck off. “Sorry Darling, we’ve already reached our quota
of Indigos this year! We are looking for a good bump around green, and
then the reds and purples I’m afraid we re</p>
<p>Wow, honestly I think we just got hit by lightning! It is 14:45 — as
if that counts for anything — and I was just about to write — “I’m
afraid we really need to…” Be less, or quieten down, or something. Maybe
I should have said Reds and Blues? Or nothing? Or more likely it has
little to nothing to do with me whatsoever</p>
<p>except</p>
<p>for a moment</p>
<p>my computer was pure white light</p>
<p>and the moment was big enough that it could start small and become
bigger, big enough to touch everything, to white it all out</p>
<p>and yet the moment was small enough to last what seemed like no time
at all</p>
<p>but i felt it in my fingers, and i saw it in my world, and i feel it
now, still</p>
<p>or else i am just making myself excited</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>it was a shock without a shock</p>
<p>we got hit</p>
<p>touched</p>
<p>by lightning</p>
<p>she said she thought it came out the fire, the stove: she was
reading, over on the sofa there, and thought the flash came from the
fire — the plug in the other room has burnt</p>
<p>it is burnt?</p>
<p>yes, the plug comes out the wall, and then there is nothing, and then
there is the livebox, the internet</p>
<p>oh shit, crazy!</p>
<p>you are lucky your computer is not broken</p>
<p>i am, maybe it was the plug? (i bought a multiplug with surge
protection)</p>
<p>…for me it came out, flashed from, my computer, and I felt it, but
only a little bit, and it shocked me, and i shouted out, but i just felt
energised…</p>
<p><em>Just because you have been touched by lightning, doesn’t mean
it’s in your writing, mate.</em></p>
<p>I know, let me get on with it, or maybe I should just leave it
there.</p>
<p>I can always pick it up another time.</p>
<p>Sure I’ll remember where I left it, hey?</p>
<p>It was around here, wasn’t it, that I put it down?</p>
<p>Something about not needing healing. Then I got distracted by being
struck by lightning. Something about how it is Rage, that is what
the fairies I know say: it is Rage, not Love, that makes the flowers
grow, by which, by witch, they grow themselves.</p>
<p>It is Rage that makes the Flowers Grow, ye WizTardZzz.</p>

<h2>15:29</h2>

<p>The power is back. Damage seems to have been mostly associated with
the phoneline. The plug of the phone is fried, blown. The plug body has
blown open and the plastic is marked with smoke. The livebox looks okay
but is not functioning. Apart from that it is just one of the strings of
USB fairy lights, plugged into the same plug as me, which has failed.
The electricity had tripped even though it was currently cut. It
seems the charge mostly hit the little room next door, where the phone
is, but as I say I saw it come out my computer and felt it through my
fingers. I still feel it now but it is hard to say if it isn’t just the
shock.</p>
<p>We stood in the kitchen as my pasta was cooking:</p>
<p>Beware the wrath of the Dark Mother, we laughed, somewhat
nervously.</p>
<p>It <em>is</em> scary, said she.</p>
<p>I don’t know, it was kind of exciting, we survived! said I.</p>
<p>Not the lightning: the weather, climate change. It is really angry
with us and we are not listening.</p>
<p>Yes, we have a lot of lesson to learn. Some of us well understand,
but most of us don’t, and the real problem ones never will.</p>
<p>And yet we suffer because of them.</p>
<p>Yes, we will just have to make sure our manner of retribution does
not dehumanise us, I joked.</p>
<p>It is scary, she said, and we held out our hands: it felt like they
should be shaking, but they weren’t.</p>
<p>It was the waterfall again, for me. The way I could feel it vibrating through the rock, even as part of me was telling me the rock couldn't possibly move, couldn't possibly pulsate. But I knew I wasn't just hearing it, even though the sounds went so low it was hard to tell where one sensation shifted into the other. She didn't think she could feel it, but I bet she could.</p>
<p>It felt like our hands should be shaking, but they weren't.</p>

<hr />

<p>Her healing is not the alleviation of a symptom, the softening of some shapeless suffering, a better way to bear some unpleasantry or inconvenience, to adjust to another injustice. Her healing is a world. Who she is is the place she is making.</p>
<p>The introspective is actually shaping.</p>
<p>Our Rage will be cold, wild, and articulate. Our action will be local and appropriate. We will do as little as we hope. A hope that is neither to add nor subtract, but to move the way we do when we move as we must to get what we are more deeply done.</p>
<p>More deeply dug and dunnage.</p>
<p>I know not everyone has a garden, but we all have a world. This is
how we are alone, and it is the way we will be together, when we are
whatever enough that it takes to let the future arrive already. That
moment we are always. Get there, get out, and never forget we got it to
forgive. It is not in these words, so let them run as they must, and run
out… let them run like metal when it is hot and raging, and shine like
it can when it is cooled and loved, and vibrate cold and solid and
raging, and flow with the great heat of love. Hum hum hum goes the
Forgetive Magnet</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>B A N G, motherfuckers. boo boom.</p>
