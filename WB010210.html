<h1>10th February</h1>
<h2>07:10</h2>

<p>Look at this patchwork of word-like bridgery weaving itself into
being as if each imaginary unit the steps of our very own feet!</p>
<p>A woven rainbow bridge, and we are walking down the green middle of
it, the most weavery part, and our past feet are throwing up flowers or
did we just tread them down without realizing and now they are springing
up again?</p>
<p>Try to answer that question but I can’t really see in front of me,
and when I look down it is all ripples and weaving and coming into
being, and when I turn back it is what I just said, the bridge of green
twist with the winter wood at the end of it.</p>
<p>Was that the Gate of Bone then? Back there? What does this stuff even
mean? I can’t access the SSEAA. I see that fellow, in my mind, sitting
under the tree. Wild horny omming one who thinks I’m in their mind.
Wants me to come. Could be where I’m going. Could be I’m calling to him.
Could be that’s what I am.</p>
<p>In witch case scratch out all them coulds, even though you could’ve
just added not not. Couldn’t knot. You’d be surprised how such thickets
and tangles give way to the comfiest cuddles. Cuddles you can delete
stuff with. Cuddles of grey cloud shot through with gold light like a
castle of all your many lives and you are free to wander the corridors
and go about changing things just like you would with a home of your own
because that is what this cuddle is. You married a witch.</p>
<p>Looking through the violet band, seeing you are seeing down, into a
pond, a pretty little pond with a flower reflecting in it, but you feel
like you are looking up. That pond is on the other twist. Remember
passing it. Some other time.</p>
<p>Remember passing it.</p>
<p>Some other time.</p>
<p>It wasn’t on the bridge, was it? That is what you were trying to tell
me, to get me to remember.</p>
<p>It wasn’t on the bridge, the bridge was in the sky from it. I was
hunting that flower for a kind of medicine. That means I was a sky
person! I used to live in the place where the sky is a ground of kinds.
That is where I first met my wife. Perhaps that’s who I am calling to?
Who I am going to see? That could even make sense of why I’d meet a
different me. He could be the place in witch I am going to meat her.
Silly boy. My name is the tinkle of that flower. The music it makes when
its sky is wobbled. It sounds a bit like an earth robin laughing. You
can see it as a tiny river in the air. Tiny tiny but you could put a
boat on it if you wanted, ride along.</p>
<p>Only round boats float on the silver bloodstream of the air.</p>
<p>I see her waking up with white parachutes in her hair.</p>
<p>I was a sky person. That makes sense of certain odds I am put at
regarding the world, my unease with it. No, it doesn’t. It makes it all
even more of a mystery to me! What can it mean for the cities to imagine
as their destiny a world I have left behind? Is their future my past? Or
did we all come from the sky, only they can’t remember, or don’t think
they can, but really it is this remembering that is calling them, and
they need so hard to hear it they are making it harder to hear… no. I
mean they hear it without realizing, and instead of admitting they have
an impossible origin, they try to manifest an impossible future?</p>
<p>I don’t know. She had parachutes in her hair. Maybe they can do
it.</p>
<p>It is probably me who is the impossible one.</p>
<p>I feel like I must’ve got turned around somehow, but I can see in
front of me again now. It is the spring gate, with the fountain, but the
bridge is winding and the window is first one side then the other of the
portalled trees. Sometimes it is the big fountain in the grand garden,
other times a small stream. More often the small stream. I am heading
that way. This way.</p>
<p>This way.</p>
<p>The stream is brown and overburdened. I am not sure it is quite
spring? I know this place, this time. I am Sam Knot. Uncle Wayback. I am
making myself laugh as I wander along the stream, looking at the piles
of branches from the blockage I cleared recently. I am laughing, saying
to myself, Yes, his name is Jacques MacWayback. I am telling myself to
read some Jacques Vallée, and to find a way to watch Jacques Lacan
playing with his tangles of string. I imagine there are keys there, that
our stories are tangled up together. Braided, hey Ray?</p>
<p>I am talking to friends in my head. Broadcasting on invisible radio
gnome. Radio gnome invisible. Something like that.</p>
<p>I feel like I have got somewhere. I did some magick this year,
progressed in my art. I said it was about crossing streams somehow, when
I started the project that would become this book, and here I am,
walking along beside the stream that runs along the bottom — it is not
not the bottom — of our property — not not that either — knowing that
now it is becoming something else, something else it already was, now it
is becoming Winding Brook, the Winding Brook of The Winding Brook
Sanctuary for Ultraterrestrial Life.</p>
<p>It was my wife who told me this place, the name of it, meant Winding
Brook. I once read an article in the local annual newsletter — I hope I
still have it somewhere but it cannot turn up again until the future, it
belongs in the next stage I mean, another installment — I once read an
article in the local annual newsletter — L’Echo d’Étenclin — I have the
latest one here, it arrived a couple of days ago — I took it out the
guys hands and tried to explain something there was no need to…</p>
<p>It was an article about the mythology of a local mound, which we have
our own ideas about, and the guy who wrote it was saying that the name
of our commune, Varenguebec, came from Norse roots and that the bec part
meant field and the varengue bit meant battle. They say the mound is an
old fortification, where the local lords tried to control who crossed
the river. The stream, the same one I am talking about. The stream of
the limper’s bridge, as it is now known, locally.</p>
<p>It doesn’t mean battlefield, said the witch, it means Winding Brook.
Varengue Bec. Winding Brook.</p>
<p>It is clear enough for me.</p>
<p>I wound my way through myself, writing all that. I passed on sideways
through the appearance of it all on the path of meaning. Just follow the
threads of sense if you come this way. Don’t go worrying you can’t see
them — you can’t see them! — but if you are here you have been following
them all along.</p>
<p>I just want to see that guy. I want to skirt around that god again.
The one who is one of the stories that the wheel of the year can be
wrought an outer face of.</p>
<p>So I’m rewinding Sam’s life.</p>
<p>I do it by running. I stand up and take off his clothes and I run
outside and surprise his wife and with her laugh I shock myself into the
bunny, I am Little Cloud and I am grey and white and very cute and I am
bounding across the sand of her riding arena towards the big mirror</p>
<p>I see a silhouette of a sparrowhawk and become a tiny
panicked bird throwing my body against the glass</p>
<p>the day was grey the mist was grey but now the world is silver and I
am springing out the mirror as the hare — Lôrien, lovely long leggéd
one, sultry cartoon sexy, slinky feather-headed Goddess too quick for
you</p>
<p>too quick for you to be other than her</p>
<p>other than the wind rushing in your ears</p>
<p>other than a slope a direction a feel in the flow of things
running</p>
<p>running towards the witch’s mount</p>
<p>towards Étenclin with all its echoes</p>
<p>towards Mary’s Spring before Mary is</p>
<p>bouncing into the lap of the Great Goddess who sits cross-legged
where the hill sometimes is</p>
<p>who sits just like he does</p>
<p>Earth Gods, Kings and Queens of Time, People of Eternity, People who
are always already here when the sky folk fall into their laps blinded
and burning and hurt and that is why some rain is Acid and some rain is
not</p>
<p>why some humans frighten at their own being gods</p>
<p>why some self-destruct and others see through the constructs to
construct</p>
<p>why the wayward need the giants to see the vision that can be beheld
by all in the unbeholden eye the wise say beautiful and think sublime
and in whose light the only dumb are the struck ones</p>
<p>you Fool who flow now towards Adjustment</p>
<p>to be her Wild Hare Pet and sniff it all up</p>
<p>the continuous stroke of the scent in the milk you are suckling</p>
<p>the strange sound in the om that is not om</p>
<p>the flailing of those who forget they have forgotten</p>
<p>become iron and cut whirling shapes into your sitting still place</p>
<p>slicing your eye striping your legs and opening your side</p>
<p>putting you in a box and making you the present</p>
<p>the present of being a thing now to care for</p>
<p>a thing to care for now</p>
<p>wound to wound you go</p>
<p>wound to wound is the spell</p>
<p>wound to wound the thought of you</p>
<p>wound to wound the healing you will do</p>
<p>the healing spell of the one eyed one</p>
<p>Give him back his eye, Little Odin. His I. Return it to him so he can
see what else he has lost. Let us all weigh up the costs of what can and
cannot not knot…</p>
<p>I am speaking to Little Odin. Down on his level. He is eating barley.
Crushed barley. And I am putting my forehead against his forehead. He
has a little white dot there. The way trees have knots where branches
are not he has this little white dot where his unicorn horn invisibly
is. Is not not.</p>
<p>Little Odin is an interdimensional traveller. A kind of sky person I
guess. There are probably many different kinds. I mean, Earthlings are a
kind of sky people too. Even the root of the giants is space. Mountains
dangling from unprecarious peaks.</p>
<p>I only mean to say he is not just in my story, and he needn’t just be
a hare, but that is how we know him here. Or try to get to know him.</p>
<p>What is it I am talking to him about? I am asking his opinion about
something. I am being silly, but I am filled with worry. I feel a great
energy impinging itself on me. Here I am, at home in my lounge, with a
fire in the hearth and my wife reading on the sofa. Here I am on the
floor talking to a young hare whose care has become our duty. A very
peaceful creature. An almost silent thing he seems. Everything is calm
and cosy, a little bit dusty but nice and fluffy, a little bit messy but
not too bad.</p>
<p>And I am scared. I am trying not to panic. I am just breathing,
carrying on as normal. This <em>is</em> normal. I’m not ignoring that feeling. It
just doesn’t really mean anything. It could mean too many things. But I
cannot just <em>decide</em> what it means. If I did that I would never be able
to change anything. It wouldn’t be like a house, I mean, or a world. It
would just be a fantasy, an illusion. It is not. Not that.</p>
<p>Or not how you would <em>think</em> that is.</p>
<p>I am asking it what it is. Who, actually. I am less than not ignoring
this feeling now. It says it is something that wants to speak.
Apparently I have agreed to be a voice for such things. But I am tired,
it is too weird, I am sorry I can’t do it, that must be why I’m
scared.</p>
<p>No, it’s not. Or not only. It is intense. You are intense. You say
you want to speak but your lips aren’t moving. Your silence is making
the world sing. Your silence is showing me what — how — you see. It is
your perception. A roaring thing, circles without circles, a raging
torrent of peace that is not not orchestral. I can see that it is music.
This does help change my panic.</p>
<p>First change the way I look at it. Allow myself to see it. To know
you are there, here I mean. This is actually normal for people like me.
Others will see the art or read the poetry, but you don’t know what it
means unless it happens to you. There are almost as many kinds of poetry
as there are people in the sky.</p>
<p>No one could have taught me this stuff. It is more like a school of
fish. A different arrangement all of a sudden. But I have had teachers.
My Grandad. Mister whatsisname. Mum. The Wizard. My wife. The hare. The
Wizard.</p>
<p>Books.</p>
<p>Books that walk. Walks that book.</p>
<p>Once I can see it, it can be a room, like the bathroom or something,
and I can paint it, make it more how we like it. A wooden bird will fly
out of the lounge and land on the new shelf there, though. Things like
that will happen, that you can account for — say it was a present you
got one christmas and your wife thought it would look nice there — you
can account for it, but this is also to admit that it wasn’t you that
did it. There are always unintended consequences. Expect the unexpected.
Remember to notice it. Maybe that’s all this is. Maybe that is what
saying something is. Maybe that is what the god beneath the tree was
trying to tell me?</p>
<p>This time, at least.</p>
<p>Just note that feeling then, that really feels like… a something in
your skull. A little patch of mud or a kind of thick cloud in your
brain. You are trying to remember something that you are quite sure is
not the thing you know you can remember, which is that the god wanted
you to find that piece of paper, with the story about the flower, and
tuck it into the pages here. Tuck it here between these virtual pages.
Reinsert it into the flow of things.</p>
<p>He wants you to make a crossing. That was it. The fuzz has
dissipated a bit. Maybe it wasn’t it, but it was something. This is you
making a crossing. This is something the gods are doing. It is okay to
be frightened, just do it anyway. It’s okay.</p>
<p>Okay. I’ll do that then, now, and we’ll call it quits for the time
being.</p>

<hr />

<p>You are making a deposit. The bunny honks. Give him a treat. This is
something in the flow of things. Making a deposit. Like a river does,
like the stream along its banks, its course. This is what banking means
to wankers like me. I am making a withdrawal, and then making a deposit.
This is how I got here. I am a deposit. A knot. A tangle of crossings.
There is not another knot like me, excepting all the other knots of
everybody. But we are all different knots, lifting things up and putting
them down, exploring our crossings. I will make myself an alter. Altar,
sorry. The kind of thing that FriendShip could use as an anchor. You
could tie down a beam, throw down a beam to it, like a lizard sunbathing
on a nice thick piece of slate in the early february sun in the future.
There is a little sign reminding anyone small enough to read it that
this place is for sunbathing lizards. You can do what you like with it,
so long as you honour their priority. This is how you got here. This is
how you help your friends arrive. This is why.</p>

<hr />

<p>Real work is never not a pleasure.</p>
<p>You can delete that.</p>
<p>Go on then, get on with it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Feeding the birds, you are reminded.</p>
<p>You were a meadow pippit when you flew into the mirror that
time. You fell down dead with a glowworm in your mouth. Weren’t there
two of you?</p>
<p>You, the one with the glowworm, became a flag, a banner, a symbol on
a shield. But it wasn’t a war you flew towards. No self-respecting tribe
would march into battle with a meadow pippit and a glowworm on their
shields. Something else is going on there.</p>
<p>You were also surprised, when you found yourself the first of the hares — who
is your second but don’t sweat that shit — Lôrien — when she leapt into
the lap of the Goddess of Étenclin she wasn’t like she was before.
The Goddess was really wild last time. Last time it felt like she, like they,
were the aliens. Not this time. This time she was wearing your own
imaginary apron. Imagine that! You leapt into her lap and she was
wearing that apron, although perhaps it was dark purple and no longer
dark green. The pouch was a flowery material, that much was
clear. So she is connecting to That Lady now, the one who
became the cliff and held you against the sky to show you how to hide
what shines in you from a certain kind of dragon.</p>
<p>She is the Goddess you are homemaking for.</p>
<p>Perhaps the book is for him though, the fellow under the tree.</p>
<p>I mean, it is a kind of home for me, for us kind of people. Not not
instructions on how to build a kind of spaceship that in a way already
is. Supergreen and ultraviolet red and blueprint for Portal Tech.</p>
<p>Now go find that leaf of the flower, my petal.</p>
<p>Do it just to make the woodpecker laugh.</p>
<p>It doesn’t even have to be funny.</p>
<p>But it is.</p>
<p>The fool’s dawn chorus stand up comedy routine for no one.</p>
<p>It is the reason robin’s laugh.</p>
<p>You almost get the joke that is the language of the birds.</p>
<p>Probably almost <em>is</em> getting it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Oh yes: and not to make the mistake of thinking you have to rush any
of this.</p>
<p>Don’t delete that.</p>
<p>You can, just don’t.</p>

<h2>11:29</h2>

<p>I’m searching for it now. I carried the great sheaf… no, it’s not
that. The weird wadge of scribblings and scrawls… I picked it up from
the wooden garden shelves in the spare room that will drive me spare if
I think about it now — it is the pit of every job in this place — I
picked it up and carried it to the table and then I went back in and
got a little more. I think that’s everything. It’ll be in there
somewhere.</p>
<p>I hope the mice haven’t eaten it, she said.</p>
<p>Oh I hope not. There is stuff in there and stuff upstairs.
Unprotected. I’ll be so upset if they’ve fucked it.</p>
<p>I’m going back into the room to check for more, saying Not if they’ve
fucked on it, I don’t mind if it’s covered in little mousey cumstains, I
just hope they haven’t eaten it or made a bed with it.</p>
<p>There’s no more I don’t think. I’m looking at it on the table. First
sheets I see have a poem, the one about smoking weed down by the
stream and accidentally causing the enlightenment of an ancient sage,
which then afflicts me with a siamese twin, a dead-seeming one, a second
tumorous head beside my own. You can read it if you want.</p>
<p>Bugs have started eating it. This is all stuff the god is saying to
me. Bugs are starting to eat your stuff. They’ve started in on the cheap
papers but you need to do something about it.</p>
<p>But I like it. I like the way it looks. Little holes nibbled in the pages
by invisible larvae. Sometimes just the surface peeled off. In places
the pencil is blurring. The biro is fading where I wrote with that.
Three years ago it was. Look how old it looks already! I’m drinking
Yorkshire Tea with milk and half a spoon of honey. Wife says Fuuk Yoo
Deek Haed and shuts the door because the neighbour started up his
tractor. She sits on the sofa saying Why does it have to be so hard my
chou why does it have to be so hard. I just keep typing she knows what
that means she doesn’t want a response anyway.</p>
<p>No I don’t want to be too un-comma-y. That’ll date right quick guys.
I know though, not the tests of time we’re trying to stand hey? Still, I
should look after this shit. I will have to start scanning it. God
sez.</p>
<p>Sex I wrote, deleted it write quack. Fuckin ell Kerouac didn’t you
realize the ride you wuz gettin on? Where First Thought Best Thought
would lead?</p>
<p>Damn straight y did lightnin Jack. Fuckin fast track.</p>
<p>Windin Brook tho innit?</p>
<p>Anyway. The god is saying. Look at this. Read a bit of it.</p>
<p>I RETURN HAPPILY TO MY SWEET ELF WOMAN &amp; THE OLD STONE HOUSE
SMELLING OF WOOD SMOKE, TO VEGETATE REASSURINGLY UPON THE SOFA,
WONDERING AT THE THICK VEIN OF NOVELTY MY TRIP AWAY SWIRLED THROUGH
ME</p>
<p>Sorry chou I have work to do (I’m reading out loud but she has a
call to make). It is all caps like that, like my handwriting is
sometimes, graphite on cheap paper, throwaway stuff.</p>
<p>PEOPLE &amp; PLACES, WORDS &amp; ANIMATED FACES, RIDES &amp; ROADS
&amp; LIGHTS &amp; TOWERS</p>
<p>Even though it is not joined up writing the god is telling me it is.
I know, I tell him, I’ve seen it, I’m going round and round this great
metalinguistic loop all the time. It’s like DNA or something, but we
call it culture, forget that’s not an answer. What the fuck man —</p>
<p><em>Assignment in Eternity.</em> A thin sci-fi paperback tucked in
there. It scares me to think of reading that. That must be why I tucked
it away. Read Empty Cloud instead. Even more intense but I knew it
would be sensitive. Didn’t know it would be <em>that</em> sensitive but
there you go, do now. Robert Heinlein, the sci-fi.</p>
<p>The god is showing me tha — reminding me that this book started
Wayback. Wayyy Baaack. I already started it. I have a book here. Look,
these are leaves of it. They’re even being eaten by insects, see?
They’re real leaves. The work is a tree! I didn’t kill it — we didn’t, I
mean — the tree is still alive look! You’re reading it!</p>
<p>Other people are writing this book. There are dead people living in
it. Blake. William Blake is in this book. It was him who gave me the end
of the thread that has no end. Him and that bloody unfinished poem of
his, that is still not done with me and I’ll likely never be done
with.</p>
<p>There are living people writing it too, so-called living people. Some
of them I am already friends with. Well, I consider them friends.
Raymond Soulard Jnr, he is writing it. Joel Biroco, he is writing it. I
don’t know about you girls are you sure you’re not just making quilts
and stuff?</p>
<p>Haha yeah, infiniteasing. You gno me.</p>
<p>That’s weird! Look at that! That is why I am writing this, even
though I haven’t found it yet, what I’m looking for — I reckon it’s in
this little pile though, the last one I picked up and put on top. This
must have been when I was writing that letter to Rob. There’s that poem
look, Andorien Sails. So many of these things were dreams. The rest of
them will be.</p>
<p>Yeah, there, in the poem about Cell Division / Getting Out Of Bed,
wait I’ll go find it again…</p>
<p>Okay I’ll play a game with it, and you can play too if you like, I’ll
write it out like prose and see if the word still stands out. I’ll give
you a hint: it is not scarecrow or existence. It probably won’t, and
even when I tell you what word it was, it probably won’t mean much to
you. This was the fourteenth of december of the year twenty-nineteen. It
is proof I was dead already.</p>
<p>Let’s put it all in italics, as a kind of magick to banish the ghost
of the trauma of fart tomatoes.</p>
<p><em>Our cell wall is quilted &amp; layered with wool, &amp; inside is
warm where love wiz pooled, as we wound our way thru night’s dreamy
ocean, transmuting every holy word into this mysterious book-feeling,
spelling out hunger, smelling out coffee &amp; fantasy cream — twin
desires almost balanced for a moment — to stay or to go, to enjoy this
hard won equilibrium, well dosed on warm doze in the cold light of the
window, little inconsequential dreams, pleasant automatic reveries, eyes
closed to open to possibilities, an endless list including coffee &amp;
cream, coffee &amp; cream, a dream real enough to pull us out of this
dream of being one thing — difference but a frisson of contentment
undercover — but you must slip out your side &amp; I, mine, we must
divide to feed these immediate goals — gopher a while in different
directions — then later we can reconvene upon the sofa, whereupon so far
this morning infinite vegetation seems quite possible, planted some
place in the moving body of this peculiar animal</em></p>

<p>Look, it’s Little Odin! I still haven’t found the thing I’m looking
for, maybe it is not in this wedge after all, but Little Odin is, here
is the passage I saw his name in</p>
<p>25<br />

<p>&amp; NIGHT BEFORE LAST: LITTLE O WENT UPSTAIRS ~ WE WERE TIRED &amp;
NOT IN MOOD TO WAIT ~ &amp; ONCE UP HE WON’T EASILY GO DOWN ~ NATURAL
FOR HIM TO CLIMB BUT DESCENDING THE STAIRS JUST BREAKS HIS MIND / GOES
AGAINST HIS BODY/INSTINCT ~ STOPS HIM IN HIS TRACKS AT THE TOP OF THE
STAIRS. I COULD SHEPHERD HIM TO THE TOP BUT NOT ENCOURAGE HIM DOWN ~ HE
WOULD TURN &amp; COME PAST ME ~ IT BECAME A BIT OF A CHASE ~ CHOU WAS
USING THE BROOM TO TRY TO BLOCK HIM FROM GOING BACK ~ AT ONE POINT
HE</p>

<p>SO IT PASSED UNDER HIM ~ IT WAS SO HIGH &amp; QUICK, SO IMPRESSIVE ~

HIM ~ PIN HIM TO THE FLOOR &amp; GET TO GRIPS WITH THE WRIGGLER &amp;
CLASP HIM AGAINST MY CHEST ~ BOTH OUR HEARTS AFLUTTER ~ &amp; CARRY HIM
DOWN THE STAIRS …</p>

<h2>12:39</h2>

<p>Here it is!</p>
<p>Now I remember.</p>
<p>The Bridge of Green Twist is called Viridelix.</p>
<p>We say it like <em>Vri-DA-lix-ah</em>.</p>
<p>(The last ah is almost silent but we’ll hear if it’s not there.)</p>
<p>The flower is known as Brigid’s Sky Blush.</p>
<p>Not everyone who was paying attention knew it was the second of
february of the year twenty-twenty, common era, but we can be fairy,
sorry <em>fairly</em>, sure that it was.</p>
<p>Whatever else the god was saying this morning, it can’t not have been
this.</p>

<hr />
<em>
<p>There is a flower that grows under the Bridge of Green Twist. I never noticed it before, guess I never passed that way this time of year. It dangles in drifts among the grasses on the Earth-facing side. The colour makes me think of... as if the sky had blood running through it. Like the blushing cheek of a blue-skinned princess I mean: sweet, soft, deep. Nothing gory.</p>

<p>The size of small apples, with seven petals, one folded deep to meet the stem, twice the size of the rest, they warble almost imperceptibly when the breeze passes like when a Wherelshell comes close, smell of warm rain, so subtle, and it only takes the lightest touch to have them tumble. Made me jump the first one!</p>

<p>It's been five fingers of sun since I ate it. Held it under my tongue a full finger. Just the faintest heat, black pepper and honey water. I'm lying with my eyes closed and the spool unfurling beneath the Bridge of Green Twist listening to the warble of them and the long overlapping shushes from the shade fresh forest. There is just the gentlest chalky fizz at the edge of my bones, a slight levitation under the belly button. The seventh petal cups my forehead like firm, cool hands, while the others pour down like Neffertem silk to intersect my thought roots.</p>

<p>I am just a little deeper than my body, and she looks different through this new screen, her face dipping down into the dew pool and lifting me up, spilling me out in a fresh morning splash. I see the world from thirty eight drops upon the carpet fennel. Converging on a forked rainbow I try to stay with the two recurves recurring. There is definite room for improvement within the attentive posture but she is kind and patient. I-can-breathe patience. With pleasure deep can I breathe patience and learn The Being Change. We can work together!</p>

<p>I sleep until the sun's last hand then spend some time gently working the Said Patterning out of the spool into a Tangle of Thanks. I can see just the place for it. There is a teardrop-shaped pool just this side of where the Bridge of Green Twist's twin feet come to rest, where a drift of Brigid's Sky Blush wends down to its sharper edge, as if curious to know the other side of its body, to peer as I do into the bounce, making it all chaos...</p>

<p>Now the Tangle of Thanks goes heavy like hair curls into the sweet night behind the chaos light like my own quiet giggles. Ah! it's so nice to walk these paths! To wonder what news has been waiting, since forever, to tell someone else, to broaden the picture of use. To collaborate on something we can't get used to: could get used to that! How it's always so fresh, how even the spent are different again, since all the finding took was a little walk, a little wonder, a will to open another time in the right place, to peek under the Bridge of Green Twist</p>

than the glance<br />
gives.</p>

<p>We released him Valentine’s Day didn’t we, Little Odin?</p>
<p>I’m sure of it.</p>

<h2>13:36</h2>

<p>The woodpecker laughed!</p>
<p>I’ll just leave it alone then, stop fiddling with it.</p>

<hr />

<h2>13:51</h2>

<p>Okay now I will.</p>
<p>Crow said croak.</p>
<p>I’m fine with that.</p>

<h2>13:57</h2>

<p>Thanks guys.</p>
<p>Gods n gals.</p>
<p>Odds n sods.</p>
<p>Allez !</p>
<p>Birds n birdonks.</p>
<p>Starts n stops.</p>
<p>It’s fourteen hundred now, let’s confuse machine lovers with love
machines again some time!</p>
<p>English really needs a hello-goodbye!</p>
<p>Salut !</p>
<p>One will probably pop up in Üngléshystânn.</p>
<p>I’ll keep an eye out next time I’m in town.</p>
<p>Follow that bunny !</p>

<p>Hang on, forgot to give you that word, the one I thought might pop out at you in the cell division poem:</p>
<p><em>Equilibrium.</em></p>
<p>That kind of coincides with the other stuff I was thinking, so I’ll
tell you that too quick, before I get back to work.</p>
<p><em>Cock-a-doodle-doo!</em></p>
<p>That god, that time he impinged on me, it became about panic. I guess
he is not not Pan. I don’t think of him as Pan — I’m thinking Cernunnos
at the moment, whatever that means to you — but there we go, probably
some overlap. Purr Happ Zzz. I’m always thinking of Pan, too,
anyway.</p>
<p>And you dude.</p>
<p>…it became about panic, and about a kind of emotional alchemy wherein
that can become, without too much effort — staying with the flow of
things — exhilaration. You don’t want to calm down, you just don’t want
it to become panic. This stuff might well be connected with Odin, too —
fury and stuff. I reckon it is appropriate for Brigid as well. Buzzing
bees, firey arrows, mead and poetry. They’re all in there aren’t
they?</p>
<p>You do have to be beside, andor besides, yourself with it. Maybe
that’s key, or pivot. Pointless point. You are always the one who is not
involved, things have evolved so God put a stop button on…</p>
<p>Something else something else something else, et cetera.</p>
<p>Et cenotaur, did you want me to write? Who is fucking with who?</p>
<p>Anyway, there’s that.</p>
<p>Also don’t forget your posture. I write that having sat down for just
one darn minute with me leg crossed awkwardly under me. And maybe you
are lying in bed or monging on the sofa or something? Just don’t forget
your posture if that is something you need to remember.</p>
<p>Better off designing a desk that won’t let you forget it, and sitting
at it on a chair that will. One day, hey? We’ll get there.</p>
<p>Well I’m going back out to work now. But we will need that stuff,
about emotional alchemy, to enter Thee Wylds. To cross into them. We do
it naturally but we need to learn to do it supernaturally as well.</p>
<p>Work. In one world that means processing willow branches, in another
world it means wearing a pair of my wife’s comfiest socks on my hands
and walking around stroking stuff.</p>
<p>It’s up to you which one you imagine, but I’ll see you in both.
Andor. Either.</p>
<p>Aethyros. You could even call him that. Metazoa as the Lord of the
Animals.</p>
<p>No idea what any of it means.</p>
<p>Except to me.</p>
<p>To you.</p>
<p>Backatcha, Divine Siblings of The Cosmic Chuckle.</p>
<p>May All Our Suns Be Rabbit’s Bottoms.</p>
