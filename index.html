    <title>Welcome to Winding Brook</title>

</head>

<body>

<p>Welcome, friend, to the hypertextual branch of
the Winding Brook Sanctuary for Ultraterrestrial Life,
currently imagining itself halfway between
an insane asylum and a wildlife sanctuary,
wondering if it hasn't finally arrived.<p>

<p>My name is Sam Knot and these are my diaries entries
from January and February of the year 2023.
They appear at times to be almost
a form of literature, but when I made some efforts
to extract these more artful aspects the whole
no longer seemed to hold together. Rather than
giving up on it completely I am presenting it
here in something not far from its raw form,
for the interested party to read as they please.
One of its themes seems to be an attempt
to discover who it is talking to, which is clearly
an aspect of its reason for being. Very likely
it is an attempt to make contact with someone or something
that exists in its inner world, or perhaps to realise
the way in which such contact is never not going on.
But there is a mystery to the soul, in that for all
its inner orientation it addresses what is very
much an out there.</p>

<p>So, this is for my fellow "out there's" out there!</p>
