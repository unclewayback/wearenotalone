<h1>January 7th, 2023</h1>
<h2>08:55 (07:55 local time) Queens Park, Bournemouth</h2>

<p>Looking in the mirror, brushing my teeth, realizing being among
people, here ina babylon, turns me into a preacher. Now that I have my
place, my base, my space, outside it all. Now that I know myself. I run
up against Babylon and rail. I rub myself up against the Great Whore and
whisper in her ear: I know you better than that. You know me better.
Let’s not kid ourselves we’re really anything other than holy innocent.
As we lie down in the mud, and phuk.</p>
<p>What was I preaching about?</p>
<p>Salvation.</p>
<p>What else?</p>
<p>It was a bounce off from a little phrase in our Daevid’s book. Gong
Dreaming 1. I had a little look at it last night before bed. It is good.
I will treasure it. He is me and we are free together, and all that. A
real hippy. And a true… bard, poet, wizard, shaman, human… clearly. It
is a bit ridiculous, obviously — “Gong is a self-initiation into…” some
kind of enlightened spirit blahblah. And absolutely true. It is a proper
trip he opens with. It is my trip too. Yours. Sum ov yooze. Unsummable
sum of ours, ov</p>
<p>I am we<br />
Are<br />
Our<br />
Zzz<br />
Eatc…</p>
<p>Like looking in a mirror, particularly noticing a spot, a little
blemish, one of yer awkward too close uglinests. Love it. Silly
begga.</p>
<p>So he says, at one point, something to the effect of<br />
Revolution not Involution</p>
<p>and, though I know what yer sayin, I also feel the fear of the alone
here. The fear of something worth guarding against — akin to
self-involvement — and something we cannot stop — akin to Nothing.</p>
<p>But how could Zero the Hero not dig this? Y know? So clearly this is
just one of those</p>
<p>Squeeze puss pop gone<br />
spot zzz</p>
<p>Still, in the mirror, I thought: so, we need to make it Real, right?
We can’t just be imagining ourselves in some kind of hippy heaven while
being milked of our love juices in some robotic matrix, or in some
drudgy purgatory sprinkled with fake psychedelic sparkles while the fat
lizard up top warms the meaningless gold we are mountin’</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>But how do you make something Real, unless it is? Right? So going on
about too much Revolution, and being all weird in yer quest to make it
happen… doing stuff, basically. Fuck that, man. Wake the fuck up, is
all. And</p>
<p><em>To</em> the fucking dream, for sure, phors ur. Metaphorce be with
u.</p>
<p>It will always come down to, and build up to, mind. It actually
doesn’t matter if the world goes to shit. If the whole pan flashes. I
mean, it does, so much… it is just, somehow, strangely, no good
motivation. Not a proper reason. Not solid ground. A wheel-less
caravan.</p>
<p>It is the inside that counts. The inside that says there is no in and
no out. Only the inside can say this, really. The outside can disappear,
get fucked, and we’re all good — every outsider knows this — but the
inside goes and it is worse than all gone: it is still here, only
not.</p>
<p>This basic orientation, that is as deep as it gets — elementary and
beyond elemental — high and low and all this that nowt n spirit n
sprites n shut up n shite…</p>
<p>This is Salvation. This is what it always meant to mean. This. A sign
post, a general direction. The Idea. All the manys that it means is up
to we. It is just the notion, the justesse gist, we have to see.</p>
<p>It was clearer in the mirror, in eye contact, eyebro xpressionz, and
the silence of thought… but there is a taste of it here. It is one of
those things that we just have to keep saying again and again, because
it is more like calling for something, that is so deeply here it is
almost always a little lost. More like an emphatic, You know what I
mean? Than whatever it is you think that is supposed to be about.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like, the pure gesture, or something. Gesture and glance? But a
glance that glances off things, and is not not you looking into
yourself, and seeing what cannot be hidden, nor shown. What is.</p>
<p>I suppose there is a sense in which it becomes more apocalyptically
salvational, more radically transcendent seeming, the more that other
‘things’, or any ‘things’ are offered as The Answers, as What You Need,
or think you want… when we don’t know it is really this ‘nothing’, this
thing we are that we cannot have, nor not have… the more the unseen is
not seen, the more the unacknowledgeable is not acknowledged, or
honoured, perhaps… the more the unshareable is… slighted…</p>
<p>The less the less the less the less and the bigger the bigger the</p>
<p>BIGGER THE MESS!</p>
<p>…but I would do better if this screen were my own face, and I were
just imagining the thoughts behind it.</p>
