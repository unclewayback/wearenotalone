<h1>12th February</h1>
<h2>08:12</h2>

<p>I reckon that’ll work, he sez, pulling on a cute wee pair of
fingerless gloves, Thank you very much Mummyz.</p>
<p>10 degrees it is, in here, I just checked. That time of the year
where it starts to feel milder outside than in some mornings. We’ll be
glad of that come Summer.</p>
<p>I have one strong image from a dream last night. It is a wonderful
feeling feeling (so nice I said it twice?) A wonderful feeling feeling,
to have experienced something while sleeping that stays with you like
that. Something <em>happened</em> man. For all the shades and ciphers,
all the echoes of my mind, all the wandering dream streets fatigued and
not really paying attention… something happened. Something stands out.
Something exists.</p>
<p>It was encountered. It spoke. It wasn’t me. Not really.</p>
<p>It was a big old White Wolf. Dead as a fucking doorknob it was.
Laying there in the grass, all tall and skinny. Emaciated but still
grand. A great beautiful animal.</p>
<p>I seemed to be… it seems to me I must’ve been wearing some kind of
headset. Or else I was using Tether or broadcasting on Radio Gnome
Invisible. It was like there was a classroom in my head. Filled with
kids. My head was split and half of it was filled with kids listening to
the dulcet tones of my inner narrator. He was doing a good job for a
change. Was she even a she? She did feel a little sultry. Regardless, it
wasn’t this mess of half-said things and crowds of thinkings all trying
to step over each other. One voice, and silence, and the feeling of
listening.</p>
<p>She is saying… basically that it is a meditation, to process the
corpse of an animal. She is going to skin it, and then carry out an
autopsy, and it will be very instructive informationally, but what it is
really about is how peaceful she is. How it is that she can enjoy doing
this.</p>
<p>I really remember this part. The feeling of gently and slowly rubbing
my hands over the contours of the old Wolf’s legs. Rubbing up his thin,
fine strong legs, and the fur was just rolling away from them in drifts.
I went up over his flank and it just curled off with the blade of my
hands like I was sheep shearing. Like it was wool, or snow.</p>
<p>I was coming up his back legs when I saw his eye open. It startled me
back, kneeling back, looking at that eye, not quite believing there was
still life in this thing. Without moving anything else he turned that
great wide head on that long old neck and gazed at me. I can feel that
face, that look. It is full of Wolf. But it is kind, somehow it is kind
and wise.</p>
<p>It is still a Wolf though.</p>
<p>I don’t really remember more than that, or if that which I do recall
was really connected. Perhaps I was back in the classroom, or on the
bridge of a ship or in somebody else’s house. There was a window, and I
think the Old Wolf was throwing himself against it. I think he’d gotten
to his feet. I think I was trying to convince someone that we had to let
him in, that it wasn’t what it looked like. I don’t know.</p>
<p>I wondered, this morning, if the Black Witch might have a White Wolf.
If it wasn’t all about Winter and Spring somehow, the changing of the
seasons.</p>
<p>I remembered that there was a Wolf — even an Old White One — in
Monmouth’s Vita Merlini. When Merlin, or whoever he wiz, gets to the
forest… isn’t there already an Old White Wolf there? And isn’t he in
retreat, like Merlin? Isn’t he fed up with eating living things, with
killing stuff? The cycles of life and death. The exhausting tightrope of
the different sameness of every step. The mad dance of it.</p>
<p>The Crazy Wolf is kind. When a Wolf goes insane, they become soft,
harmless. All the other Wolves would think them mad. Bad. There’s a Big
Bad Wolf in them woods, dudes, wouldn’t hurt a fly…</p>
<p>Could be.</p>
<p><em>What shall we do? I know! We’ll cut off his eyelids and make him
watch nature documentaries until he remembers the role he is meant to be
playing!</em></p>
<p>Maybe that’s why Wolves howl at the moon? They think it is the
ancient eye, blind with the light of eternal sight — the ancient eye of
the one that they wounded, one of their own, and they are saying</p>
<p>Howlo Old Friend</p>
<p>Howlp You Enjoy The Showl</p>
<p>!</p>

<p>In other news I showered with a spider. It is not uncommon for one to
be hanging around in the general area. But this is one of the first ones
back since I redecorated. There was a Mister Seven Legs in the bath the
other day, who I managed to help out, but this fellow was on the wall.
The back wall of the bath-shower.</p>
<p>Hello Incey Wincey, I sez, haven’t you heard the song?</p>
<p>(The shower is on, my evening wash underway, and I’ve only just
noticed him.)</p>
<p>Down the water spout and all that? Washed the spider out?</p>
<p>He walks down the wall a little way.</p>
<p>Careful mate! What it means, basically, is that there is a powerful
force in the area that is tending towards that there plug’ole, and if
you happen to get caught up in it — slip or have some kind of an
accident say — that’s your lot, you’re gone, done for.</p>
<p>He’s just sat there, or stood there, on the tiles.</p>
<p>And then he retracts one of his legs — he’s facing down, it would be
his front left, L1 — and he seems to have the end of it in his
mouth.</p>

<hr />

<p>I was just thinking, if you’re my Mum, you might not be able to
concentrate on what I’m saying because you’ll be worried I might catch a
cold?</p>
<p>Don’t be! I’ve got me chest covered! Those gloves are great, and I’m
quite well wrapped up all told. I think it’s better like this, to be
able to tolerate a bit of freshness at this time of year, but obviously
as time goes on things should get at least a little bit more
comfortabubble.</p>
<p>Not <em>too</em> cosy though. Just enough of a cushion you can still
feel the seat beneath your cheeks. The firmness of the old tree.</p>
<p>Anyway, so I’m just waffling on about taking a shower and talking to
a spider, but I won’t repeat myself because that’s the great thing about
me chatting away like this, you can repeat me for me if necessary.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s why I’m doing all this?</p>

<hr />

<p>Incey Wincey Spider is taking leg L1 to his mandibles and doing
something with it. Is he having a drink? Is he catching up drops on his
hairy bits and then sucking them off?</p>
<p>Look, he’s doing it with R1 now. I have to say, it looks awful much
like he is cleaning himself.</p>
<p>It’s not just that I happen to be taking a shower, and there is a
spider on the wall.</p>
<p>Incey Wincey is showering <em>with</em> me.</p>
<p>Imagine if there was a children’s rhyme about <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>I think that’s the way I’m trying to direct us. That’s what I mean
about setting metaphoreal coordinates. That’s the way we pilot this
thing.</p>

<hr />

<p>There is a world in which this first diary is all I ever manage to
publish. I think that is the world of Mabon Calling. That is the world
Amulet is stuck in, or feels stuck in. <em>Get stuck in, love, and there’s
nothin to get stuck in!</em></p>
<p>She is telling one of her friends, I think she’s in the insane
Asylum, before they open the portal and it becomes the city. She’s
telling one of her friends how there is a world in which Uncle Wayback
carried on writing. Where he wrote diary after diary. Maybe not all the
time, all his long life long, but more than just this one. That’s the
world she wants to get into.</p>
<p>I’m not so sure you should come, my lovely. Do you have a children’s
rhyme about taking a shower with a spider in your one?</p>
<p>Maybe it’s in the future of this one?</p>
<p>What if we’re all in each others paths, somewhere along the line?</p>
<p>We’re doing that thing, making a kind of human chain, in which each
of us is a link to freedom, we’re all helping every last one of us get
saved. We’re being beamed up by FriendShip. It doesn’t matter what world
you think you’re in. This is it. This is what Objective Reality really
means. It’s a kind of adventure story. I’m telling the truth and you
knows it. That’s what telling the truth means, it’s finding a way to say
what you already know. That’s what feeling is about.</p>
<p>The storks are back.</p>
<p>I saw them at the farm shop yesterday. I was asking Catherine, or Katrine
or whatever her name is, ça va bien? And she was saying how nice it is
that Spring is here.</p>
<p>(Is that why we call them Springs, I thought, while fetching water at Mary’s, because they
are colder than Summer but Warmer than Winter?)</p>
<p>I walked out the farm shop door and saw them there, the storks, the same old couple sat on top
the beheaded, or decrowned, oak. Maybe that oak is the king of the
marshes?</p>
<p>(Birds and flowers, baby, that’s what you want to wear on your arm to
tell the time, just like the Goddess does.)</p>
<p>Long necked birds were an ancient metaphor for wisdom. I can’t
remember why. I don’t think it was that their heads were that bit closer
to the sky. I think it had to do with the length of time it took the
thoughts to float up out of their hearts — the greater distance they had
between feeling-thought and thought-thought — it gave their ideas more
time to mature.</p>
<p><em>There is a philosopher in his world who says it is the best of all
possible worlds,</em> says Amulet, <em>do you get me Cyril?</em> (That must be the name
of her partner in crime) <em>In their world they are able to prove the
existence of God! There is a world out there in which you can know that
God exists! Imagine that!</em></p>
<p>You are crazy Amulet. Not insane. But you are mad, just like Old
Uncle Wayback. Be careful, love, be careful. No need to go tieing any camels up, just keep your many I-zzz fixed
on kind. That’s what our star is. There is no world in which God exists. You’ll see. It’s better like
this. It’s how it was <em>designed</em>.</p>
<p>See you in the hedgerows!</p>
<p>Eternally yours,<br />
Uncle Wayback,<br />
The Anti Auntie,<br />
&amp; Little Cloud.</p>
<p>(Bunny, Bitch and Bizard.)</p>
<p>P.S. I was just reading back through and realized I needed to
change a Wolves to a Wolf’s, I accidentally middle-clicked and pasted
in</p>
<p>(Little Cloud?)</p>
<p>I don’t know how that had gotten onto my clipboard, but the point is
that the bunny is indeed a little like that Wolf. I have met the Bunny
in the sideways and his spirit is big like that, and powerful. Now,
something… hmm, I was going to say that something has told me the Bunny
is Happiness, but then I was also thinking that that was The Happy Hare,
our little wild one, because the Bunny is the Cuteness of the Absolute
Truth isn’t he?</p>
<p>The thing is, is that the confusion is wonderfully appropriate here.
A rabbit is not a hare, they are really very different creatures who
just so happen to have converged on a similar set of solutions to the
problem of survival as a kind of furry flea upon the body of this
non-objective beast — here inside its living imagination/living-and-dying-dream-world.</p>
<p>We need to be able to make the distinctions, see how definite and
apart they are, but our confusions are not always confusions, sometimes
they are secrets, sometimes they are whispers in the language of the
soul, showings of the way of the world, which is a many furled one.</p>
<p>For Old Wayback, the Hares, no matter how many they are, will always
form — metaphorm — a kind of Trinity. The Thing — Althing? — He is
coming to know as Meld. Meld has a twist in, in that He can be
transformed into, or also metaphorealized as, a Chaosmillogical
Fourfold, who is She, who we call Merge. The twist is the White Bunny,
the patchy grey & white rabbit we know in this world as Little Cloud. Following that
Bunny, the Great Cock-a-doodle-dude can dance the Sheela-na-jig and
get into the position that is Giving Birth To Twins.</p>
<p>In other words, for us, what we mean by Happiness is something like
The Cuteness of the Absolute Truth, although perhaps without so much of
a twist in? It is domestic, inbred, silly, and it is wild and thoroughly
capable and surely rather sirius, despite having some stars in its eyes,
and being more inclined to crossing them, and going dotty about being
infiniteased, than knuckling down and producing machine readable prose
or well well well-proofed poetry.</p>
<p>Run on, sweet ones.</p>
<p>The meaning of time is a river of honey.</p>
<p>Space is an ocean of milk.</p>
<p>The senses we make of eternal youth.</p>
<p>Aether as Innocence.</p>
<hr />
<p>P.P.S. Can you have a look to see if there is a romantic novel in
your world, called something like The Scientist and The Poet? It will
just be one of those cheap paperback things. If you find it please bring
it with you and put it in the capsule in which you find the SEA.

<h2>11:20</h2>

<p>I just finished Big Red Zap Book. Caught up in looking back into it —
weird ways in which the end connects to the start… and those blank pages
I left there. Weird.</p>
<p>They’re not blank anymore.</p>
<p>I have to try quite hard sometimes to resist typing smileys in here.
I prefer putting them in by hand, or else…</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>I was looking at… which page? Fourth leaf. The bit about Asymme… tree
zzz ? The particuliar sort which interest me. Above</p>
<p>DEAD METTA PHORSE</p>
<p>(I remember what that sez.)</p>
<p>…and I’m worrying if my eyes are on the way out. Other day against
the sky I was sure the old floaters were more visible. Now I have… some
kind of shadow. Blurry dark spot in my</p>
<p>VISION!</p>
<p>11:25! The Starling just flew out the fireplace! AGAIN! Glitch in
matrix! Recorded. Anti… sip-ated? Yum, some tasty vintage. Solone
Starlingo! Haha! I got my own message!</p>
<p>The dark spot in my vision was a money spider (see? I’ve been dead
since… since before analytic syntheses and shit. No ur a kant.)</p>
<p>The money spider is on the pile of cheap paper treasure.</p>
<p>As I was finishing writing weird messages to myself — I’m not sure if
this particular thread will be backwards or forwards in time because I
have blue books in both directions — I heard a noise in the chimney.</p>
<p>I was sure a bird had come down.</p>
<p>I opened the stove door to be sure. Said:</p>
<p>Follow the light, my friend. Added:</p>
<p>The <em>down</em> light.</p>
<p>Nothing happened.</p>
<p>I remembered finding that dead sparrow trapped in the new stove
upstairs, in the space that isn’t finished yet. Dead inside the stove
with the door closed. I popped back up just to be sure I’d left it
open.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Nothing happened. I wrote about that. Figured it must’ve just been a
feathered fella up top sending some soot down. That happens too.</p>
<p>Then, just there above, I’m writing this and can see the stove in the
left of my visual field, when soft as feathers fall a starling plops out into
the ash and just
sits there a moment seeming a little dazed. I slowly reach for my phone,
Ol’ Galactic Swansong, but by the time I’m flipping back faux-leather
the bird is jumping into the air with a tiny black swan-like warble and
curving up into our inside sky and then Phwp!</p>
<p>Straight out the door!</p>
<p>Not like last time when he spooked and flew into the painting, into
The Monk By The Sea. I wrote about it. I’ll dig out the reference. I
might just pop it in here. Dunno.</p>
<p>I think the Starling, at least the ones you see by themselves, away
from their murmurations — Solone Starlingo — they have something to do
with the Dark Twin, the one who dies or is killed or sacrifices
themselves. They mean, in part, somehow, that the creation of this world
is itself a journey into the underworld. For some folk, at least, it
could be.</p>
<p>I can feel a way in which that’s true for me. It’s all topsy turvy
though.</p>
<p>It gets tiring, trying things on inside out all the time, but its
worthwhile somehow.</p>
<p>Instructive, if not exactly informative.</p>
<p>Toodle peeps.</p>

<hr />

<h2>15:56</h2>

<p>I just wanted to say, sigh, that I was reading some of this to Chou,
and that is good and helpful to do. She listens and enjoys it. She
enjoys</p>
<p>— I’ve just taken this outside, sitting in the arena down by Clive a
minute to keep an eye on Mush —</p>
<p>She most enjoys the bits that have a bit of story to hang on to, when
I’m going about my day and such, or off into my world in the sense of
inhabiting and exploring my universe. The place this place really is,
for me, metaphoreally. I enjoy that stuff most, too, so it doesn’t surprise me that
she does.</p>
<p>I had shown her the bit I wrote at the end of my Big Red Zap Book, as
part of my explaining the starling scene above. I am very conscious how
oblique and personal that stuff is, and also how very true and important
it is to me: This is the thread I am following, the story that is
actually happening to me, which is the… I don’t know… condition of
possibility? for this one, the one I am telling or recording. I don’t
think it is pretentious or something, nor really navel gazing, but I am
very aware of the ways it is a bit ‘up my own arse’. But then hyperdimensional tori all wayzzz our. (Hehe, sorry, hi, yeah, me again.)</p>
<p>So she said that she preferred the bits where she got to see my enchanted world. She’s really
greatful to me for enchanting things here, making it a magick place to
live, which to me it just is — and yet… it is the ideas that make it so.
The ideas have to be here, but you have to have the ideas / get the
idea.</p>
<p>So I had read her the thing about the text string I was processing:
The Metaphysics of Today will be The Physics of Tomorrow.</p>
<p>— Mush mush? —</p>
<p>— Ha-hey Bunnage! —</p>
<p>And explaining how it had done something strange for me when I was
hanging out with Old Man Willow yesterday, but that I’d forgotten to
write about it. So I’d made a note near the end of the Big Red Zap Book,
think it is the last leaf actually. And in that I sort of consciously
passed something over to a different me. The basic idea is that there is
one of me moving backwards in time as well as this one moving forward.
But it’s not so linear, it’s a knot, and there are multiple crossings,
places we come close to each other. But we see each other more like… a
feeling that someone is on the other side of the screen, or a sign in
the environment, or else just a “knowing” of some (it’s indescribabble!)
description. In fact the idea is probably closer to the notion that,
just as we need two eyes (at least, I guess) to perceive space, which
is to say depth — we need two Izzz — meZzz — or an I and a me — to see
time, by which I mean meaning. One me is</p>
<p>Hello! Here in this world, scarequotes as “necessary”, chatting to
you, typing away, seeing his reflection in the screen, the bunny
sunbathing out the corner of his eye. The other is
elsewhere. Nowhere. One of the ways we talk is dream, and other ways are
wending all through this more or less creative process. The other is in Eternity.</p>
<p>So, perhaps because of the text string I’d read, she said that it was
the more metaphysical parts that held her less.</p>
<p>It’s not really metaphysics, I said.</p>
<p>She agreed.</p>
<p>I guess it’s more like… ideas? I don’t think I could show how this
place is enchanted for me, how that works, insofar as it does, without
giving you all… putting <em>too much</em> across. Because ideas are
excessive, somehow, just in a very clean or clear way (it’s me who is
the messy bugger (that’s clear enough!))</p>
<p>I wouldn’t be me without all of this madness, the good and the bad
and the ugly and the… hey, we’re all weird! At least the good the bad
and the ugly all have this in common… kind of beautiful isn’t it?</p>
<p>But I don’t want to put you lot through anything <em>too</em>
unnecessary. You know, any more than all this is. Than you and I are.
Well, maybe we’re necessary now, but only because of… as a limit case of
that massive unnecessary thing no one did.</p>
<p>I can hardly be arsed to find the time, half the time, to read stuff.
But when I find something I like it’s no effort at all. It sweeps me
up.</p>
<p>I’m thinking of something Ray once said, about how he just wanted
more of stuff — in response to the general tendency for artists or
writers to whittle stuff down — Ray was like, No: Expand! More!</p>
<p>I love that. I won’t unsay all the things it doesn’t mean. I love
it.</p>
<p>You can always scroll past, right? Come back to it another time or
not. You’re in control now (me, the reader). I’ve done my part (you,
the writer?)</p>
<p>— Now Chou is walking Quixote around the
arena, me and bunny are sat here at the edge. It’s sunny. Lovely. Domestic Bliss! It
took me quite a lot of work to get at all comfortable with being gently
happy like this. I hope you will appreciate some of it. —</p>
<p>(Why not join us down The Lazy Pheasant for a pint some time? I’ll pop
the flyer in your bag, about how to sign up for The Haunted Microphone,
our metafictional open mic. Just three wee hoops to jump through. I’d
love it if you made it. Make my day it would. Widen my horizons. Bring
all this to life.)</p>
<p>...That’s the idea anyway. You might not be someone who needs to, or can
enjoy, pure ideas. No surface, just ideas. I’m not really. It just
happens sometimes.</p>
<p>I’m an idea, you’re an idea. It’s just an idea, I suppose.</p>
<p>Speaking of which: I’ve been thinking about my use of the word Meta, that somehow it is leaning more towards Among, and a little away from About:
say it is more like among-about, and not really at all around-about. One of the things this means is that you can’t really have an idea about an idea —
we don’t do that kind of meta — it means that if, or when, you have an idea
about an idea, that is the idea itself, being among its elf. Mice elves.
Radio Gnome Invisabubble. Glorious never-ending bunny bottom.</p>
<p>But still: it’s not all process any more than it’s a bunch of things, or
stuff, some’ow.</p>
<p>Why can’t we all just get along? Verbs and Nouns all holding hands
around the world… no wait: Among The World Zzz !</p>
<p>Yes. That’s the idea.</p>
<p>Hello? Is manyone glistening?</p>
<p>This is MC Sam Knot, speaking into the Haunted Microphone, wishing
you all a very hippy eternity, right now, ever present… aether presence?
Why Knot. Aye aye, ’s been loverly torquin’ at yer. We’re always open.
Keep on getting weirder but don’t be a stranger. Toodle peeps honey
bunnies. Ciao for now spiderman. In a while horse’s tail. Until we meet
again hermit crab. See you in the morning birdonks. Send me that off
button. Next time you think of it. Surely it would only take a thought
to make an off button for thought? Maybe that’s what breathing is… but
surely not? How could it be if I’m already doing it? How could it not.
Maybe that’s the trick. Maybe I’m dreaming about trying to get to sleep
again. Shall I bother trying to wake myself up so I can go back to
sleep? Let me just turn the dial a bit on the old invisible radio, find
some nice crackling inbetween the stations. Ah, yesh, thas the shtuff,
Radio Among. Some nice sleepy between time sounds. Gentle noise of
always… never silent sighing of the stars… quiet space laugh… the way
closed eyes cuddle the dark.</p>

<h2>19:01</h2>

<p>This is an ebook right? No one printed it off did they? Don’t do
that! It’s not designed to be that kind of a waste of time, or
spacetimeaning or whatever. It’s designed to be the kind of thing you
read on one of them devices, some weird branch of the Solidstate
Enigmatrix and Archives.</p>
<p>Books are something else. Something Else. I <em>will</em> make them,
I already kind of do. All the info is in here somewhere if you want to
write to me and ask about them. They’ll be worth a few bob one day, if
business as usual manages to become unusual instead of dying on its
feet. They’re a tad more expensive than the kinds of books you used to
buy in shops, the sort you mostly find secondhand nowadaze, because I
make them by hand, mice elf. Me and my team of well-paid elves. House
fairies and such. I’ve got this lovely little beastie who does all the
full stops with his arse. And his mate dots the eyes. But it’s me what
crosses all the tease.</p>
<p>Is my catalogue out yet? I can’t remember when I am! Have I told you
about my Blakean Business Model? Another one of those jokes I’m serious
about? Some other time you say? No worries…</p>
<p>What else was it?</p>
<p>I want to dig out that piece about the last time a Starling flew out
the stove, that seems like something I should just do, not that I really
want to.</p>
<p>That Dawn Chorus Boy wants me to tinkle on his piano-thing with him,
I’m quite looking forward to that.</p>
<p>But there was something to say, from earlier…</p>
<p>Maybe it was just that thing about what kind of book this was. Sorry,
I’m meant to be giving you more credit than that. You’ve probably
figured it out yer sen hav yae nae?</p>
<p>Loik…</p>
<p>Waay Baaack.</p>

<hr />

<h2>19:26</h2>

<p>I’m looking for that piece with the starling in, have done a text search through the logs for
the title I remember: 12-12-20-something and it’s thrown up 022021-log.txt</p>
<p>I’ve just started scrolling through, and who should pop up but
Lôrien! I was trying to remember how old she would be, earlier, and so
here is the entry that shows she would be two, and so the Happy Hare could well
be one of hers.</p>

<hr />

<em><p>-10:42 5/2/21</p>

<p>We have had a little hare delivered this morning by Agnes, she found
it being played with by a cat. It is currently resting in a little shoe box
with a towel at the foot of our bed. We will try for a first feed
tonight. Very cute, very small — perhaps even younger than Little O was when he arrived
— and unlike him appears healthy &amp; intact. It has only been a year since Little Odin left us, 
wasn’t expecting to meet another fairykins so soon! Like him this one has a faint white spot in the middle of its forehead.</p></em>

<hr />

<p>It seems her full name was Lôrien TipToe Radigost Knot. I have
written a note saying that Lôrien was one of Tolkien’s Vala, connected
with dreams. Radigost is a Slavic god that some equate with Mercury. I
seem to recall the name meant Welcome Guest? It was the probable root of
Tolkien’s Radagast, my favourite of his wizards. There are some rambles
there, regarding Radagast’s connection to my own wizard, and a common
theme of failure, being perhaps connected to an inclination not to take sides.
Some other time!</p>

<hr />

<p>It’s not in there anyway, just me talking about listening back to my
reading of it and making changes. I’ll get myself something to eat and
dig around a bit more.</p>
