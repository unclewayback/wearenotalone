<h1>January 11th, 2023</h1>
<h2>08:44 (-1) Charity Farm</h2>

<p>A kiss against a castle wall outside the tourist season. Winter slick
upon the stubborn stones of an ancient complication. All attentions feel
unwelcome in this miserable village mood. There is a weather inside
everything not even open eyes can exclude.</p>
<p>A mist we cannot miss, an obscurity that is itself the thing to see.
A pewter chalice, woolen curtains, smoke into rain, rain into rivers
grey. Light this thick, breath like uncooked bread, dreams like songs
without movement. A drab flag too wet to flutter, a pressure too
constant to gust.</p>
<p>Just gravity to adjust the dust into heaviness enough to get hot.
Just dust to become the stars, old homes to freckle the body of my
beautiful shade. To feel her weight lift and say to me, My Sun, the
Earth is not your Mother. You have the Blue Sky eyes of Our Father, my
lover, you think like Our Daughters the clouds.</p>
<p>And now that tomorrow has come, let us go walking.</p>
