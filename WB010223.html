<h1>24th February</h1>
<h2>08:14</h2>

<p>The previous entry is something I needed to say to myself. The
rest I’m not sure. I’m quite tired at the moment, from some hard work
yesterday but also just anyway. I had a very revitalising and solid
little meditation yesterday. Very clear. I sat and it was just there. I
drifted a few times but without really losing touch and came back to it
easily. It felt a little like riding a motionless horse, as if I had to
still myself in order to mount it, a kind of moving backwards in a
sense, and then voila, just sat there. The Surungama Sutra is vivid,
rich, and clear. It requires a clear mind and sharp attention to follow
the arguments and make sure you’re catching the examples — sometimes
feels like there’s something going on with the examples beyond the
argument, and the visionary passages are really brilliant: you really
feel gathered, one of the infinite worlds drawn close to this lovely
hall and beautiful garden to hear the teaching.</p>
<p>But the bunny stuff I’m not sure. I feel like I wanted
to tell some other story in which the focus was just those first nights
he ran away, before he first broke his leg — to imagine a tale therein, of his meeting
the Hare people and encountering their strange religion… but that has got
me going back over my story of, with, and around him.</p>
<p>So I thought perhaps I could just do that, tell that tale, but for one
thing it seems too much — too much for the next month I mean — and for
another thing it feels like perhaps I have to write the other chapters
first, and so maybe all this work is meant for another time, another place… upstairs
in my workshop, piecing it together with a little more distance?</p>
<p>I guess I’m not finished writing it. All these are meat and bones in
the still becoming broth of it. I'm still living it.</p>
<p>I thought I could do the work retracing the bunny’s steps, and then whenever
I got to a place where he went adventuring I could let my imagination leap off
after him. That’s not a bad idea but I’m just not sure it is for
now.</p>
<p>Just keep up my diary maybe.</p>
