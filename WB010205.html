<h1>5th February</h1>
<h2>08:17</h2>

<p>Stroking me, she was, as we passed in the kitchen, me on my way here
and her out to do the mornin’ horsies. Stroked my face with a big
purposefully clumsy hand, like a cartoon stroke. I just kept my eyes
fixed on my dark white coffee, not wanting to spill it. “You looked a
little dark,” she sez, “just needed to stroke it out.”</p>
<p>Must be that fella from last night. A shadow of mine, it seems.</p>
<p>I think back to meditating in front of Mary a couple of days ago. The
cars, rare enough though they are, go past so slow. I can’t help but
play one ahead of itself. The car of anticipation. So by the time one
car has passed it seems like two have. But at least I’ve no mind to
imagine a third. Unless that was it? Quite delayed in that case.</p>
<p>There might be at least three of ye then. One scouting out ahead and
one taking up the rear. You might not all be so similar. All you, but
quite different. And you, are you always the middle one? Can the middle
one sidestep into other middle ones, or can <em>they</em> try to step across,
push you out the way? Maybe the one behind can catch up, maybe the one
in front is plotting something. That would be just like them wouldn’t
it?</p>
<p>Do you ever have that thing when your dream is not not just you lying in bed
there, thinking — feeling — something?</p>
<p>I am dreaming that I am lying in bed thinking about a me in a
parallel dimension who was unable to get over the idea of not being able
to produce an heir. Who got fucked up, and remained fucked up, about
their own deciding not to bother doing that, and who couldn’t accept,
not even really think, that it was indeed their decision, and instead
took it out on their wife. Who never wanted one from day one. The Witch.
Larvae she calls ’em.</p>
<p>Maybe it was that moment, way back, when you had the idea she
might’ve snuck off for an abortion without telling you? You, Uncle
Wayback, not being unused to contemplating strange ideas, saw this one
for what it was, and you told it in no uncertain terms to fuck right
off. So not uncertain were those terms that you just rejected that whole
scenario completely, in that moment, to the degree that you believe you
may have done so, or tried to, even if it had been the truth. So it’s
not so unreasonable to understand that a person, at least a man, can do
that. Just decide, on some deep level, not to entertain an entire line
of thought no matter if it pertains to something real or not.</p>
<p>Maybe that was a fork. A head fork. Or maybe that was him trying to
step into your line. Or maybe you created him in that moment, created a
kind of shadow from the depths of your decision. Not just pebbles in
ponds what cause ripples now is it?</p>
<p>So last night you were thinking about this guy. Or dreaming about
thinking about him, because there came a moment when you weren’t quite
sure if in fact you were him. Something or someone seemed to be trying
to make you imagine that you were. You saw yourself saying horrible
things to your wife. You saw in fact that your sweet, here in this
world, part of her stress comes from what your shadow man is doing to
her shadow woman. You ask yourself, are they shadow people then? Or are
they somehow who you really are?</p>
<p>Aren’t you meant to have a son? Wasn’t that your mission? How could
any of this other shit really have any meaning?</p>
<p>You know you’re dreaming. You are lying in a kind of parallel bed
having these thoughts. You need to get back into your real bed. You need
to wake up. It’s not a matter of you beginning to believe this shit.
It’s just the question of the degree to which it has you in its grip.
Will you just wake the fuck up now? Why would you want to spend any more
time in this awful boring cunt of a person’s presence?</p>
<p>I’m trying. This isn’t my bed. Someone is stood over the head of it.
Over my head. Behind me there. I’m fighting without moving and there’s a
kind of greylight strobing going on. I’m getting angry now, I’m drawing
on the immobile rage, the rage of paralysis: you know the void is
already fucking growling right?</p>
<p>It is the moveless which curls my hands into claws and rattles an
animal curse out my throat as I shred this dream. This ghoul. I lift
myself out of this grave state swiping my claws down through the air and
the growl is in my throat and in the room with us.</p>
<p>The bunny patters over to sit on the cushion under the bed, beside my
head. Silver Bunny Sleep Protection Services.</p>
<p>I wonder if he just woke from his own little nightmare?</p>
<p>The phrase Forlorn Quanta pops into my head. It means something
musical. Something that sticks out, say, in a flow of sound, and
experiences a kind of attrition. It gets chipped away at, sanded down.
But it doesn’t disappear, it builds up somewhere else, becomes part of a
beach or a bank. I think it is like a stray note that eventually finds
itself part of a melody, even a symphony. The trick is that it has to
stay a little forlorn somehow, and that it has to remain quantifiable.
The essence of the thing is the mutual interdependence of these.</p>
<p>She saw two hares this morning. One in Granny Smith’s Square, the
other in Silver Willow Holloway. She thinks the first, smaller, is the happy
hare, and the second, larger and more relaxed, might be Lôrien.</p>
<p>You see Wayback sat beside the pond, and you know he is in one of his
more solemn moods. He chucks a pebble in. Did you see that? There is
something in the moment that is also in his eyes that is not what it
looked like. You think you did see something.</p>
<p>Here I’ll do it again.</p>
<p>How strange. He is smiling at you now, knowing that you saw it. The
pond dropped onto the pebble. It was the pond that dropped onto the
pebble. You feel the little pebble rising inside your skull — as if the
weight of thought was lighter than air — as it settles on the bottom of
the pond. It is utterly transparent to you in this moment that for this
to be the case, for the pebble to be resting on the bottom of the pond,
the pond must have dropped onto the pebble.</p>
<p>It is strange, says Wayback, Well, it is weird, in fact.</p>
<p>You can see how he is lonely in these moments. You can’t keep him
company, only feel yourself becoming lonely as well.</p>
<p>Gravity is the persistence of the Universe in its Original State, he
says, and this time it happens just like always: the pebble drops into
the pond of you, who were ready and waiting, and sinks out of view.</p>
<p>It becomes a memory. But what is that?</p>
<p>A horse and a spoon, or a fork and a cat?</p>
<p>You are up on a hill with Wayback, looking down into a valley. There
is another hill on the other side, covered with woods. The one you are
on is quite bare, all gorse and bracken. A river winds its way along the
floor of the valley and leads out to a wide floodplain. He is pointing
off over the floodplain to some structures on the horizon, the only sign
of human habitation. Might be a wind farm.</p>
<p>They think it is more like a fork and a cat, so that is how they
treat it. They stroke it until it purrs, and they pick it up and use it
to stab things up with. It does seem to purr, and it does stab things
up, so I guess they can’t be wrong about that.</p>
<p>But it also just stands there, doesn’t it? And it holds stuff. It
spoons and cups. It stands there, but it also lifts me up.</p>
<p>They measure success by this thing they call purr and their ability
to stab things up. But the purr is not a purr it is the sound of what is
always there they just tune it out. It tunes itself out so we can get on
with other things. Like apparently moving. Like being the legs of trees.
But they think they are making it happen with their stroking, the sound.
And this is the birth of the growl. Of hackles and of howls.</p>
<p>The cat was never domesticated. All the wild still sings. Wolves sing
and the screech of the barn owl is sweet music and the quiet constancy
of slugs is sublime. One thing doesn’t eat another, except in the vision
of the false god’s feast. They are the ones who eat. Stabbing things up
is a way it makes things seem. Makes me seem crazy it does. Makes me
look a failure. Makes me hard to understand.</p>
<p>Because what I mean is itself understanding. And it is so direct I
have to become Winding Brook. The gentle babbling of happiness over
blesséd bedrock.</p>
<p>This is what it means to know the horse and the spoon. It’s the only
way I can think just now to try and say it. Beyond all the stories that
seem, by which I mean seem real, there is one that doesn’t seem at all,
that we call the truth, but which can never be real. Unless we admit the
impossible.</p>
<p>Deep down we make a decision to be allies of the truth, and then we
know it is no decision at all, and we cannot exist, but here we are, and
where we are and who we’re with… it’s horse and spoon. And they’re
trying to say that it is fork and cat, and not even because they want it
like that. Because they don’t know any better. They are under the spell
of getting worse.</p>
<p>You just have to let them get on with it. They will be eaten by the
cat, and they will be stabbed up on the fork. They will sit with their
own yellow eyes in the dark, and they will sift the streams of their own
minds for gold until their tools rust. Their fork will become a stump,
and one day become a tree again, whose seed needs spooning up and
carrying around, in order to realize the nature of its not getting
anywhere, and the joy in growing nowhere.</p>
<p>The cat will become their clothes again. The clothes under their
clothes they make both to tame themselves and to feel their wilds. It’s
a way to keep themselves sensitive, which you need to be to ride a
horse, apparently. It’s a little like riding yourself. You make your own
skin feel so good to wear that it feels even better to take it off.</p>
<p>That’s the value of thinking cat and fork — it is all about not-cat
and not-fork, just it can take a lot of thinking to really realize that.
Whereas horse and spoon is just horse and spoon. Except you can’t have
that without seeing the tree and all the rest of it. And you don’t even
need to realize it. It’ll realize you. The spoon is a wooden one and the
horse’s bits come from the stars. It is just one light the sun and the
moon. The night and the day and the clouds and the soil and the pen and
the page all one sight. All metals precious but not all feathers bright.
That we draw lines at all but the sign of a single thread.</p>
<p>How could we not become Winding Brook?</p>
