<p>Art is<br />
sometimes best?<br />
underheard, too</p>
<p>Amongst the bacon sizzlers and the fume guzzlers and my own
announcement filled arsehole, notifications in the night</p>
<p>Please don’t overlook my screen, I mean<br />
don’t even look, overlook me<br />
underhear</p>
<p>The big window ghost lit by whatever moon rays manage to make it
through the storm cloud, a little white glow somewhere near the top
there, way above the big black hill</p>
<p>Pig scented grimace, quiet evil witch glance, it makes more sense
than ever</p>
<p>EVIL</p>
<p>with someone else’s fat mist sweating on my fingertips, and the
tastiness of cousin flesh smelling more like burnt hair than ever,
stomach turning revolt at other people’s invasive breakfasts</p>
<p>And they all hate the fresh air, natter on about Cracks Where The
Light Gets In, but godforbid ye changeth the air, stale-cosy-meat-dust,
cloud not of Daughter Cloud</p>
<p>At the bottom of the big picture window that looks west towards the
big hill who divides the unglesh fram thee kymry</p>
<p>Is another little ghostly glow wracked up strangely seething sobs,
pulling me up from god knows what dream to a no more figurable reality,
all witchy white in blue black and gorgeous ghostly death pallour of
true night life</p>
<p>What most folk call the social, or else don’t even imagine they
imagine the normal, as we joke we’re all mental… it most all remains an
imposition. The Alone is alone the true social, closer to silence than
languagedge babble. But all I really mean is for the Cosmic Anarchist to
be sure we UnderStand this. FriendShip is as far as you can get from
imposition. To most it will appear, if it appears at all, rather meek.
The fierceness is of the unseen, and that which cannot be unseen</p>
<p>Seething and shaking there, louder now I am awake, keening unseperate
from the storm, shaking with the great wind, butterfly violent, bursting
cocoon power, trembling cornered tunnelling of truth only those it
doesn’t need to get away from might glimpse, and go to</p>
<p>Go to it, the so weird shaking she, the woken from a nightmare woman,
the terrible news in the sudden just gone she, shaky, support whispered
soothe presence, strange strange strange feeling, not knowing yet</p>
<p>Not yet knowing</p>
<p>yet</p>
