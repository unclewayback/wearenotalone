<p>Excuse me, terribly sorry I've had second thoughts about this, it
was helpful to do a test share as it provoked some sort of crisis in
which I was able to see quite clearly the extent to which I was talking
to myself here, trying to tell myself something. I'm still not sure what
to do with that but I'm taking the diary down for the minute, and am
going to have a bit of a think about it. All the best and thanks for visiting!</p>
<p>(I'm rewriting, there was something worthwhile sharing in it - just
too much else besides!)</p>
