<h1>January 8th, 2023</h1>
<h2>06:49 (-1 local) Charity Farm, Herefordshire</h2>

<p>Just looked at the big map on the utility room wall. Offa’s Dyke
running along the ridge of the mountain just behind. This side England,
that side Wales. Black Mountains. Thought of Ginsberg, Wales Visitation.
Hang on a minute, what’s that? Just the other side of the mountain from
us: Capel-y-ffin… sounds awful familiar… and… a farm called The Vision?
Little standing stone just along the way there too. Seems like I might
have to cross that mountain one of these days!</p>
<p>Feel very at home here. Lovely place. Very homely.</p>
<p>Filled with people though. I’ve no issues with any of the monkeys.
But how my witch will fare up remains to be seen. Thought we were up
nice and early, to have some time and space for her to convert a little
matter to energy, but seems there are other sleepless wanderers in the
night. And so she sighs. And disappears now. Good riddance I’ll say for
the minute. I love a good witch, but I’ve no time for a misery.</p>
<p>Oh, I don’t know. Well, I do. I knew this would be hard for her, but
she’s so quick to it, the old umbrage.</p>
<p>But is he going to sit there and spark a spliff, the big lump? I
should hope not. A fart might sometimes share a common space unasked
for, but other smelly habits we should have time to take outside.</p>
<p>Gods, was it? Sounds a mite petty to me. But then, what else have
Gods to untertain emsen wiv?</p>
<p>My bottom.</p>
<p>Let I revise some of the adventures of yesterday, before we get to
the many tomorrows of the hopeful aventures of yestayonk. Ah, goodness,
outside he goeth. Bless.</p>
<p>My bottom.</p>
<p>Come on then, have yer way meat robot.</p>

<hr />

<p>What shall we do, we wonders? One day edit out all these verbal
bottom burps between the fluff of the stuff?</p>

<hr />

<p>I’m alone in this room now. She’s probably better off just eating in
her room. Has no ability to wait it out, or to shield or screen herself
off. Bless her, really. Some kind of psychic fabric must have ripped at
some point and I don’t think it’ll ever be sown back together. Best for
such as she to do as she dae n find the place where ones threads have a
friendly wind to blow in, and apart from Thee Wylds there just is no
comin an goin, to in n fro in, but that she is aknowin.</p>
<p>Me though, I say, where do ye fink ye are? Who is there? Where is
here?</p>
<p>I rant to myself, then I say, but yea, was it not just a page ago you
were not quite able to screen out her face stuffing from the side of
your mostly empty screen. A blinking cursor.</p>
<p>I love rage. I do. I know it now, how vital it is to have a current
of indignance coursing through one, to know this readiness to no. But
the trick is merely to thrill and to thrive with it. Enjoy the energy of
ones aliveness.</p>
<p>Not that it really is alive.</p>
<p>I can’t tell quite what I mean by that now, for the feeling itself is
a somewhat serious frown. Not serious, actually, just set. There is
something set about it. It is the brimming and the dam both, that is
what it is. You think the brimming, the swell and pulse. You take a
moment to feel, and you know the rock all this is ‘against’. The wall of
still. And still it is. Isn’t it?</p>
<p>Let me go and see her upstairs a moment.</p>

<hr />

<p>Well, I shall learn a lot about shutting the fuck up, I think, this
holiday. To try to change another is… I don’t know, there is some kind
of aphorism here. Like… It is folly to think of your ways as fit for
another, and a kind of evil to hope to change them, even for the better.
‘Better’. Get well soon, weirdos. Just look after your own shit, and
you’ll look after the rest of us that much the better. Better, still
that much the lesser than good.</p>
<p>My, I smell the reek of his weed now. Crikey.</p>
<p>Let’s do our thing then, and forget all these things, and follow our
trails.</p>
<p>The sudden knowing that the smell-less-ness of words is a blessing.
This much maligned abstraction. The strange feeling that most of the
time the being against, the active denouncement of a thing, is but an
admission of ignorance. The kindest not liking is silence. Silent love
that goes not into or against what it is not. What it does not care for,
it does not not care for. To not get involved.</p>
<p>All this, somehow, with the simultaneous awareness of so many
wrongnesses in this world. At least of the human sort. World. The known
world, the human. This stranger in a strange land, who is never more at
home than in the fellowship of the alien. But, yes, that all that is
really wrong is our doing. And that the paragraph above does indeed know
and say something about that. And that some idiots think that to turn
the other cheek means to make of us a walkover! I wonder then, at the
word Meek. Meek and mild.</p>
<p>Just be so here that you’re not. It is the mind which matters, and
where is… and who… and so…</p>
<p>That these words, this writing, I thought as I drove, fast along
those tight little roads, keeping us entertained by entertaining myself,
and knowing how that can barely come across here. Not like it is, like
it lives. It can, but that is as down to you as I. It is just the
feeling, the being together — but the being together is the feeling. Of
course.</p>
<p>But I knew that words are no different to a pencil sat in front of a
flower. We tend to assume because you can make a likeness of a flower
there is something more direct about that, about the connection between
the picture and the thing, than the word and it. But there isn’t. If you
actually take the time yourself to look and to copy, and then to think
and to speak and to write, to live in one way, to live in another, you
will realize the unvisceral point of these simple self-evidencies.</p>
<p>But the other point, for now, for these writings and this project,
and for you who like a thing to grasp as given. Oh, among the little
distractions that now make me yearn for an outer silence to come — and
then to know that it shall, and all these sessions of different kinds of
weathering will serve it well — the other point is just to know that
this is not that, and never will be.</p>
<p>It is clear that they have things in common. This is me talking, it
is communication. It is an outpouring of life, a ripple of the energies
we necessarily and unhabitually shed as our business goes about us. It
is thought, it can sound — it has things in common with sound. And with
smell, and vision, all these sensual embodiments.</p>
<p>But it is something else. It is its own thing. Not just writing but
this writing. Not just me but it.</p>
<p>So you let it go by in its own way, and learn you a thing or two
about what that is. And it is not unlike driving along sometimes, not
unlike yesterday, and as much like tomorrow as anything can be, maybe
more so in certain important, almost mystical, ways.</p>

<h3>The Magpie Omens</h3>

<p>Two of them I saw, first that morning. And a good morning to ye,
Mister and Missus Magpie, said I, happy to see man and wife
together.</p>
<p>Two for joy. Even for being a bit high, slightly manic.</p>
<p>Hello, I said, to the youthful quester who had just entered my Mind
Cave. You are looking for the One King, no doubt, even believing you
have been sent by him, to find him. Who else, if there be but One King,
could have given you orders? Yes, Our Lady, of course. But how many is
she?</p>
<p>Anyway, you have not found him yet. I am the Wonking. Not the wrong
one, just the other one. He is the One King, I am the Wonking, and there
shall be no Wanking here.</p>
<p>Now feel free to come on in and settle yourself down in one of me
not-so-cosy corners. We have a lot to cover.</p>
<p>Who are you? I said, to the unfamiliar person I hadn’t yet met, among
the bustle of my family.</p>
<p>He laughed: nice one Sam.</p>
<p>No, seriously, all I know about you is a little uncanny feeling, like I expected to see you,
somehow. I have no idea who you are.</p>
<p>And taking a dislike to him then, as he laughs again.</p>
<p>Who is this guy? I ask the others, to raised eyebrows and awkward
laughs.</p>
<p>Come on Sam, he says, it’s Davo.</p>
<p>Who the fuck is Davo guys?</p>
<p>Oh Sam, says Mum, please don’t start all this again. Your poor
brother.</p>
<p>I’ve never seen him before!</p>
<p>And then darker visions, weirder. A scenario.</p>
<p>I arrive. My brother has fallen. Fallen far from something. Everyone
is distraught. I need to see him. I mindbask in the unstoppable thought
of his twisted death grimace. My brother, all broken, busted, gone. I
mindwail, a great wail of pain.</p>
<p>I see another Magpie, alone. I wish him, and his wife, well. I hope
it is not an ill omen. I think, who’s to say if this is one magpie or
three? I will think it three.</p>
<p>Luckily, though my mind wanders, enough of it is fixed keenly on the
road. The wheel suddenly shoots off the trailer of the car in front. A
piece comes flying off and hits the road just in front of us, but I am
already slowing down, and Chou is hitting the hazard lights to warn
those behind, and after a wobble and some screech the car with the
trailer is pulling over and we are going safely round.</p>
<p>And then there is one more Magpie. Sat on a signpost, looking kind of
shifty, as if recently harangued by other birds.</p>
<p>It is late that night I count them. Four for a boy. And I learnt only
tonight that they have a boy on the way.</p>
<p>Douglas John, he says.</p>
<p>I see what you did there, say I.</p>
<p>(Cyril Douglas was Grandad Ross, and John Leslie was Grandad Iles.)</p>
<p>Do you remember what Douglas means?</p>
<p>He doesn’t.</p>
<p>It is dou-glas: gaelic for dark water. Dark so that you can see your
reflection in it, like you find in the bogs.</p>
<p>They laugh, when they hear water and bog the first thing they think
of is the toilet.</p>
<p>No, like, dark peaty stuff. Rich.</p>
<p>I shall have to search for Bog Sculpture, which he then
mentioned.</p>
<p>And check on that word Glas. I seem to remember it also had something
to do with Amber? And then I wonder about Glas-tonbury.</p>
<p>And feel all the fizzle out of writing about things that
happened.</p>
<p>When I draw a flower, it is not a flower, it becomes a knot.</p>
<p>I will find the way to write the writing only. Of course, it is also
a matter — perhaps even more of a matter — of finding the place and the
time…</p>
<p>What else is mind?</p>
