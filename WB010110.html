<h1>January 21st, 2023</h1>
<h2>07:21 Winding Brook</h2>

<p>Didn’t sleep so well. Bad sinuses from mixing Boby’s food into the
big container, I reckon. A lot of dust. Have salt-washed my cranial
cavities this morning. Should have done it last night. And/or worn a
mask. We gots plenty of facemasks going spare.</p>
<p>Busy day it was. Started with painting the woodwork in the bathroom.
Then had her horsey duties as she was at work. She asked me to put the
shit around the newly planted trees in Capability’s. She was in a
miserable mood, in particular talking about that: five wheelbarrows a
day through the mud and across the fields.</p>
<p>Honestly, it was hell. The path through the snake garden is deep mud.
Deep deep in the centre for the barrow wheel to get stuck in and churn,
plain deep on the sides to suck your feet, and then a waterlogged ditch to pull it through
and a mound to pull it over, all before you are into the lumpen
obstacle course of a field. We tend to pull it backwards on such
journeys as it gets stuck less often, but even that is made more
difficult by the fact that the plastic handle-grips have long ago left
the metal tubes bare and smooth.</p>
<p>I only did it twice. Had to wonder, as I asked her later, if she
didn’t deeply hate herself on some level, or else feel the need to atone
for some horrible sin, in putting herself through that five times a day.
After all, it is we who decide such things are necessary.</p>
<p>Are they? Is it? I asked. I knew her main reason was to mulch in case we have
a repeat of last summer’s drought, as it will help them to retain
more moisture. But I could go to them in summer, when the clay is dry,
and water them and cut the grass around them and mulch them with that.
But she has compared the marsh oaks that we mulched with shit, with ones
we didn’t, and the mulched ones are growing where the other ones are simply
surviving. But maybe it is the location, I say. She doesn’t think
so.</p>
<p>She laughs when I ask her if she isn’t trying to atone for something.
Her uncle once visited, and his main comment was, Why are you punishing
yourself?</p>
<p>Maybe she is more of a Catholic than she lets on?</p>
<p>She was happy simply that I had experienced what had been making her
miserable the past while of mornings.</p>
<p>You see? She said with a smile.</p>
<p>I’m not sure, said I, I was still singing and happy, even though it
was hell.</p>
<p>(Okay, I wasn’t.)</p>
<p>Yeah, that was one of the things I thought, actually: that if you don’t have a fair whack
of rage in you, you just won't be able to bear a place or a mission like
this. If you are doing a hard, tough job, then you will have to battle against
it. Sometimes you will get it wrong, and rage inappropriately or let it
cloud your judgement or turn you into a stubborn headbasher against
brickwalls — other times it is just part of the natural way of things,
and it will be part of your experience when it is part of what is
powering you, and then not. It will be something like a torrent of
energy, like a wild river that you are submerged in, salmoning upstream
against it with your wheelbarrow full of eggs, but you will be able to
leap up out of it with a wave and a smile when dearest bird friend
tweets hello.</p>
<p>Five minutes until my first meditation bell rings. I had wanted to talk a little
about Daevid Allen’s Gong Dreaming 1 &amp; 2 books — I am glad I sought
them out and paid the price, though I wasn’t sure I wouldn’t sell them
straight back on at points, feeling it all a bit too flakey hippy. Or
maybe it was having to ride the length of the Divided Alien’s silly shaft one
or three too many times (says he who is never more than five words away from the nearest toilet!) But our stories are rife with
lessons for each other. I mean, really it does go deep with him. He is
one of those people, for me. Another Wayback. Far out.</p>
<p>But I was thinking of this in particular because of the rage
connection, which is something he struggles with, in the book. And also
the weed. And balancing his deep sense of serious spirituality with
silliness, expressing his quest somewhat sillyly… well, my bell is
ringing, and my friends the Gong are a band of ringing bells, and I am
very thankful for Zero the Hero and the entire dancing show and singing
tale of friendly mythical madness allah metaphoreal.</p>
<p>Time for me to kneel in the direction of Meta and Zero in on nuffink.
Chao!</p>

<h2>08:36</h2>

<p>Ending alarm didn’t go off for some reason — maybe because I was a
bit late getting to it? But that would imply some kind of
schizo-electric untervenshun, so clearly not!</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>Not great meditation, yet — but feels good to be back at it, and
there is some kind of gain in the posture. It is both more relaxed and
more solid, but is taking time to unfold.</p>
<p>I had one interesting little thought train, that caught me and has
stuck with me… made an impression. It was related to portals, here
called The Gate. Related to change — ah yes, that was it: the initiation of
the thought concerned some remembered comment about how psychedelic use
in the West was, sort of, irrevocably tainted with the frameworks,
terminologies, or flavours of… Religions, basically. The hindu ones,
buddhism, christianity. Perennialism. The occult? Obviously it is the
case, to a degree, and probably not the whole story, to other degrees.
The shamanic current is not nothing, hey? Indigenous inputs. And as much
as they may be in tension with existing Western, or whatever, ways of
looking at the world…</p>
<p>Anyway, the idea was that this was a gate. This chaos of influences.
That somewhere among their interference waves was some kind of a
more-or-less coherent picture. The idea was that one needs a way in,
something to transform. Thus it wasn’t a trap, not a dead end, more a
shifting state of affairs. An initiation. Just because one begins with a
certain set of assumptions… I mean how can one not, in a way? Even if
they are made for you. By reality, or your organism, even.</p>
<p>Likely all this was itself stemming from the idea of the Yogi taking
a trip and just meditating through it. The radical perspective-altering
and wilding of phenomena fundamentally just another example of, or
opportunity to realize and abide with, that which does not come and go,
or come or go.</p>
<p>Which is in a way The Gate itself, as well as the journey.</p>
<p>The image of a landscape, again. Stream, grassy knoll, and tree.
Sitting there and realizing it is not not the gate that one passed
through. The soul drawn towards a picture, a painting, a portal, in
which all the life’s journey is… not mapped, but presented, presenced.
Can be tasted, smelt, heard — and all these in musical quotation marks…
for what are senses but the one thing sensing? And what is that?</p>
<p>Whispers from Sirendos, again. The will to go there. Will someone
from there guide me? Will I make myself an inhabitant and guide
others?</p>
<p>Portal as picture. Still like a picture is, and yet in all that is therein…
alive, moving. Entered. Picture after picture, and picture beside
picture in a great big picture without beginning or ending… without
bigness or smallness… yet infinite detail, endless definition… end less
de fin it — shone.</p>
<p>The feeling that there is a little more white in my beard, since our
time away.</p>
<p>The feeling of the work, which is also the feeling of a lapse in the
work, the ins and outs of condition. Wrists, shoulders, back… mostly the
upper half of the body… but the legs needing to stretch, the hamstrings
not not the spine… everything a bit stiff.</p>
<p>Good to stand on the head again.</p>
<p>I face Oberon, more-or-less, in my ablutions. I don’t remember him
from my meditation this morning, but I remember him looming last night. It
is a friendly silhouette, for me. The Great Hare. The sculpture is
lacking in a few places: the haunches are not quite big
enough but the nice big back foot somehow compensates, the front legs
don’t quite seem in proportion but the overall impression is good, is
correct. I am very fond of it.</p>
<p>I had a nice little play, last night. After doing the horse work,
then cleaning the lounge and kitchen, and snarfing some lunch, I went
back into the bathroom and painted all the walls. A nice light pastel
green — a bit like the glow that comes through the window in summer and
spring because of the wisteria in front. Very satisfying. Should have
done it years ago.</p>
<p>But yes, I painted until late, just after 21h, and just before bed
fired up batwag, dropped in a recording from Galactic Swansong — nice
little ramble from the church at Ferté-Macé back in August 21, that
drifts off into the quiet atmosphere of the place — chose that nice
Glitch Piano in Pigments, and just played. First time didn’t leave
enough space, second time was much better. I recorded the midi only —
should have done the audio too as quite a lot of random in that patch.
Anyway, it was nice to do and gives me a boost in terms of thinking
about moving forward.</p>
<p>Telephone people are due today, to have a look at the lightning
damage and get the net back up. Last we heard it would be Monday at the
earliest, as more complicated than they first thought. We’ll see.</p>
