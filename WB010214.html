<h1>14th February</h1>
<h2>07:49</h2>

<p>Happy Valentine’s Day, especially if you are alone.</p>
<p>I am thinking of calling a council of ideas just like you.</p>
<p>The hope for imaginary council?</p>
<p>I don’t know. I had thought not to write today, give myself and
everybody else a break. Pop</p>
<p>Regaining My Decomposure</p>
<p>on the ol’ Jukebox and disappear up to my room</p>
<p>climb out the window and just become an up and early worker bee</p>
<p>go buzzing about visiting the primroses, crocuses</p>
<p>not much anyone else about</p>
<p>the violets will be here soon, the daffodils.</p>

<hr />

<p>Too much gets done without an idea.</p>
<p>Can’t really be a doing without some being in it though can it?</p>
<p>An unbeautiful train station.</p>
<p>Yes, it exists, but it isn’t, really. It is not.</p>
<p>You think because there might have been plans, because that bit fat
into thirt, there was an idea behind it? Because people could’ve said
what the purpose of it was?</p>
<p>I don’t think so, I honestly don’t.</p>
<p>Only some whys might lead to all wayzzz? But wheel get there in the
end, hey?</p>
<p>Then I’m really not thinking of or talking about or aiming for concepts. Or
what I’m currently intuitively conceiving of concepts as. I expect this
is all quite coherent, more so than it might seem. Also clearly there is
a certain amount of correspondance going on. No, no consensus.</p>
<p>But then it really is very serious.</p>
<p>I was once able to conceive, as if an insight, that my mania —
excitement, idealism, enthusiasm, but all a little too much, all flying
around at thoughtspeed and refusing to stop at the lights — wasn’t
different from my depression. Just a different face of it. An attempt to
give myself or everybody else a break from it. Or a flight, an escape.
Like fantasy.</p>
<p>Like some people think of or use fantasy.</p>
<p>I have no idea how, right now. I figure that if you are in some
somewhat perturbed or sensitive state, whatever you read is going to
play into that. But it’s not true, no, not the case.</p>
<p>Some books have gods, or ideas, in them. Or they are built like
shrines or… even cages — viewing windows or barred portals. Places
things — ideas, like us — can meet. Maybe we can only stand either side
of a kind of screen, at least to begin with (while we imagine we’re
alive perhaps). I don’t know.</p>
<p>(Robert Heinlein can fuck off, by the way, Assignment in Eternity my
arse. It’s just a random paperback I got from someone who was chucking a
bunch of books away, but there’s no ideas in that. Nothing to animate my
death. Just wank.)</p>
<p>Anyway, now I wonder if the insight hasn’t changed to… my silliness,
in the modern sense of being a little stupid and finding things
generally humorous… isn’t it just a flight from, or abreaction to, how
serious this is? How serious I am? How deeply I — we — must mean it?</p>
<p>No, it’s not, I can answer that surely and cleanly and quick. It’s
not. But!</p>
<p>I know what you’re saying.</p>
<p>You are profoundly silly, at least you can be or appear it sometimes
because it is in fact what or who you are, because the very thing you
are serious about has a kind of lightness to it. But it is not exactly,
or even exactly not, a This World kind of light.</p>
<p>And you do say stupid or flippant things sometimes. And you do say
things you would be better off not saying. And… sometimes reach above
your station when you are not careful to feel for the very thing you
mean.</p>
<p>You do rush and leap about. You need to just feel it more, let it
circulate. It is not everything. It is only something in a very special
sense.</p>
<p>Is it you, or</p>
<p>A you, saying that?</p>
<p>This?</p>
<p>This is imaginary council.</p>
<p>Even though I cannot really feel it, or don’t feel it in the way I
somehow think that I should… we are in touch.</p>
<p>That’s what the energy is. That’s why or how I can just relax more,
chill out a bit. That’s what I’m trying to explore, to teach myself
about — to learn from you — and thus that’s really what I’m sharing
here, whatever else it seems like.</p>
<p>I guess when it’s wrong, when I get it wrong, I’m not even… not not
even… just not sharing. Not the right kind of odd.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’m Zero the Hero am I? I’m not sure that’s you
either.</p>
<p>It doesn’t really make sense, it really doesn’t, to do me and you in
that way. Me who and you who.</p>
<p>You who?</p>
<p>That was my Granny’s greeting, what she would call out whenever she
arrived, came in the open door letting people know she was there.</p>
<p>Yoo hoo!</p>
<p>It’s not a question is it really? Listening isn’t really a question.
It’s that glistening feeling. This one, when you notice a breath that
was emphasised somehow, an in breath mostly. A breath that was something
more than necessary, not necessarily graceful, but gracious,
somehow…</p>
<p>Like I imagine a little girl couldn’t be graceful, but how cute it is
when she is gracious — and this not being grateful — like that but in
the absence of anyone to thank, and very clearly having nothing to be
sorry for.</p>
<p>There are tears I may never cry in this book.</p>
<p>They don’t really have a why, like you might think, like I might
think, they could have. They could have but they don’t. They are what
they are. That is a pure idea, it is true.</p>
<p>I do have pure ideas, but I perceive them… as they are. They are a
kind of emotion.</p>
<p>You can’t reason about this, you can’t rationalize it. You can try to
talk about it, to let it say stuff with you, but that’s poetry. Poetry
would never say you were cold, as if incapable of warming yourself up.
It would just kind of slide past — no, you would. You would walk past
it. Your eyes would just roll, not even dance, over it.</p>
<p>I wish I was a music teacher.</p>
<p>I wish I <em>had</em> a music teacher.</p>
<p>It’s too late now. Honestly it is. For me it is meant to be like
this. I need to play with and learn from the ideas, and hopefully I can
find a way to… hopefully you will find a way <em>to</em> this, if it can
be at all helpful.</p>
<p>There is no excellence, without learning to be okay about things.
Thank you for your council.</p>
<p>I will practise leaving it there for a change.</p>

<h2>09:57</h2>

<p>That thing Ray once said, that in the Cenacle he wants to show his
writers at their best, and me reflecting back on the mess of my process
— that wRiter’s Notebook thread — thinking stubbornly against him</p>
<p>I don’t want them to see me at my best</p>
<p>I don’t have a best</p>
<p>If I tried to do that none of this would make any sense</p>
<p>Also I just can’t. I lose perspective if I try that.</p>
<p>If you like what I do, and me when I do, it’s because it’s all good,
and we don’t need to unsay those things, because it’s all good because
we’re all good, and we’re all good because we’re not all good…</p>

<hr />

<p>This Sunday Underwater</p>
<p>Tuesday as it maybe</p>
<p>Play Mystic Piano</p>
<p>Against an echo that is</p>
<p>That is also open to your voice</p>
<p>Listen to the birds</p>
<p>Fade out into the crackle of the fire, the lighting of the fire</p>
<p>…open to your voice…</p>
<p>…don’t be afraid to whisper…</p>
