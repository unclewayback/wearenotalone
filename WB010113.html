<p>When all you need is a sine, but all you can find is saws.</p>
<p>— idea for an electronic track: some heavily subtractive fun: try to
move from full saw through some more characterful flavour to a more or
less pure sine tone, then likely cloud and cluster out from the
sines —</p>
<p>Maybe something like that would help? Thinking more in terms of, and
thus exploring a little more, those two classic forms of synthesis?</p>
<p>RGBW additive, CMYK subtractive… or vice versa, I suppose, from our
perspective? Adding pigments together, combining them, or filtering
white light.</p>
<p>It is just that the world of computer music is at once so expansive
and so limiting. I fiddled a little last night, on Bitwig, with some of
the Perfect Drift presets, and made one little looping phrase that was
ok, sounded kind of classic, a bit like Harmonia or Cluster, at least in
flavour… a bit 70s in other words. But not very inspiring.</p>
<p>That is one of the places that Bitwig, maybe electronic music programs
quite widely, seem to lead: the sounds all sound ok together but its
not really the music I want to make.</p>
<p>Then there is also a way in which so many of the sounds want to stand
alone — not like with guitar and bass and vocals, or an orchestra — the
sounds are, or seem, less complex but more in need of their details,
which are often hidden once a few others come into play.</p>
<p>I know that this can be worked with, and there is a way to approach
it with this in mind, I just have to get there.</p>
<p>Also, however, some sounds are nice as they are, alone, and nice to
just play. They are already instruments, really.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was thinking that, unless I have an idea, like the sine/saw
one above, I would be better off just unblanking the canvas — working
with a little bit of field recording, or a phrase or Wayback ramble or
something. Laying something down or in there first.</p>
<p>Rather <em>doing</em> all this, than writing about it, of course.
There are so many strands that writing it all out would be a mess — but
then I think: if I am doing this, then why not try? Maybe that is what I
am asking of myself? A list, or scheme, of approaches… maybe if I put it
down in writing, or show that I can, it will help?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>As with a poem, start with an idea, which is normally not not a
title. Not necessarily a musical idea, as I am not there yet, apart from
intuitively with my voice, but one which can be explored sonically.</li>
<li>Seeing as we mentioned voice, and that is our main instrument: work
with it, explore it. Start with it sometimes. Try sketching out an
arrangement purely vocally. Put some words and sounds into the sampler
and riff on top of that. Then there is the Boss looper, from Uncle
Rainbowz, which produced Our Unicorn Prayer, Maybe More Than Once Upon A
Time… wouldn’t it be good to keep that set up and ready to record for
immediate intuitive sessioning?</li>
<li>Enjoy learning and studying, take your time. Learn classic synthesis
methods and sound design. Learn Western Music Theory. Learn to sing.
Just never let any of this eclipse your experimental-first
feelosophurry/konfu pranktiz</li>
<li>You like to be surprised. Sometimes you want to play with something,
often even, that does not behave predictably. It takes time to set these
things up, but is worth it.</li>
<li>You also want to be able to express a musical idea reliably, you
want to be able to accompany yourself in song one day, to some degree.
So you need to learn to play standardly. I say that sometimes taking a
Wayback ramble, and jamming along, could be a good way to do this and
still produce somewhat utilisable soundage. But also sometimes it is
just nice to play, and see if it fits anything later. And also not to
record at all, just practice. This should be happening every day.</li>
<li>When you do find a nice musical idea in those experiments, you
should keep it, learn it, understand it. It often happens there is a
moment or a while you really connect, or enjoy. Learn from those
times.</li>
<li>There is so much more, in terms of detail, or crafting this or that
set up — but you have to know when to stop, or what to speak and what to
not — I feel that what you have written above is far enough to work with
for now. The details will work themselves out.</li>
</ol>
<p>(Funny how it moves from I, to Our, to You. I for an Idea, O for our
being together, U for the dynamics of directional address, Y kn0t?)</p>

<p>I had interesting dreams last night. Following someone I don’t know,
who I respected and admired, round the mountain. Recall being in a place that was somewhere
between an apothecary and a museum, and being shown something that was both
gustatory delicacy and head-spinning drug — bit like a fart bomb, too, but
a lovely one: you snapped the pod or packet open, see — and I didn’t
realise but that was basically the moment of consummation, a quick
sniff — so I broke one open and soon realized I had wasted it, or
nearly, so I took a ridiculously big sniffage of it, and clearly that
was a bit much. I just stood there staring in the midst of a wild rush
that was at once a concentrated meal of flavour and scent and a
transformation of consciousness, a trip! The friendly elder who
was showing me around took me out of the way, somewhat laughingly
— it was silly what I did, but good that I managed just to stand and
stare and not to flip out or knock anything over. I feel as if the whole
night was friendly and rich and full of dreamscapes and dream sensual
experiences. I jokingly wondered if it had anything to do with the lack
of internet, upon waking.</p>
<p>But we turn it off at night, she said.</p>
<p>Yes, but maybe it lingers in the air? I wide-eyed: At least I don’t
have to wear my tinfoil hat this week, it is nice to take a break.</p>
<p>She was just sat on the sofa drinking her coffee and looking at me,
see.</p>
<p>I was like, What are you doing?</p>
<p>She was like, Just sitting here thinking.</p>
<p>Wow. (Because normally she’d be scrolling.)</p>
<p>…thinking of how I will ask you to roll the hay bale, and place the
three trees…</p>
<p>(Because she didn’t want to have to come interrupt me and break my
flow, but I explained to her I wanted to write the poetry of the
interruption one day, and so I appreciated it really, even if it
sometimes made me a little flustered or frustrated, it was quite like
working with chance.)</p>

<hr />

<p>(Just opened the present I bought micelf from the Chalice Well gift
shop — Labyrinth notebook plus a pamphlet: The Earth’s Cycle of
Celebration by Glennie Kindred. It is well infused with the vibes, man.
kan shmell thee incense!)</p>
<p>(One thought for the notebook, apart from how its cover mirrors the
Breaking Convention logo, is that it will be this year’s Cuckoo’s Call
book. I had half wanted to keep with the 22/24-line form — this book is
blank. But somewhere between that blankness, and the labyrinth on the
cover, is the idea that forgetting about form is appropriate for this
cycle. I’m going to put it back in its brown paper bag, and just consult
the pamphlet for wheel of the year ideas.)</p>
<p>(Another idea is to go back to Lunations, but I think that is for the
future — maybe the Cuckoo Working can bring me to an understanding of
the metonic cycle? Or begin to. It will help to keep it quite
Gregorian, or standard, to begin with, I think. Bring the 13s in
later.)</p>
<p>One slightly funny sour note with reference to the labyrinth book, apart from
the fact that it cost 12 pounds, was that I felt the need to say Bless You to
the lady behind the counter, and felt awkwardly inauthentic afterwards.
Saying Bless You to… no, it wasn’t that: it was that it was considered
and not spontaneous. I was pleased with the way she wrapped it in the
paper bag, folded the edges and put a little sticker on to seal it. But a
smile would have done. It is that thing where the incense-and-unicorn-vibe almost becomes oppressive somehow, and you end up bending like
light and saying purpler things than you are strictly speaking
comfortable with. So that is in the Cuckoo Working, somehow. I am
wondering a lot (without really wondering, just opening to the
possibility) about the Goddess of Spring being not simply Mothery… well, of
course she is not! Perhaps more or as much she is Lover. Fertility means
fucking as much as or before being born. But not just this, that also we
are dealing with Time, and temporal cycles: Spring is lovely and lamby
and friendly and flowery — but the Cuckoo is weird as fuck, right? We
already know that the Goddess in particular is thought
triple, witch I shpell trial, which might seem a more masculine
approach, and is I suppose a bit <em>Perceval</em>. I will have to dig into that
material.</p>
<p>Funny to be in that part of the world — Monmouth, ish — where
Geoffrey wrote his Vita Merlini. Interesting the strong Norman
connection there. Interesting that thing with de Lacy and Llanthony, and
that Saint David was some kind of hermit on that site, before… All
those Yew, too.</p>
<p>So: there are eight faces on that old cauldron. On the outside of it, at
least. One missing. I need to study it. The Goddess of Spring is the
Goddess of Spring, but witch is it: Equinox or Beltane? Imbolc? That the
Goddess could be completely Spring while never not being Maiden, Mother,
Crone. The Fool, and Lady Justesse. The sense of a wrong, of a weird,
set off by the strange knowing that all ways are rite. If that path, say
the one of confusion, where the boundaries themselves become their own
blurring, can be walked, even in an ungainly fashion, it cannot be wrong
to do so (or need not be the wrong kind of wrong to try)… but it is strange. Somewhat inelegant, foolish. This is why I
need Justesse. I wonder who she is in the Arthurian Myths? Does she
split into Guinevere and Morgan? Try to unite in V V Vivianne?</p>
<p>There was something else.</p>
