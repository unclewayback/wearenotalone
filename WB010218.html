<h1>19th February</h1>
<h2>08:03</h2>

<p>A soft, pastelly morning, slightly warm.</p>
<p>The Hellebores are very happy, she sez.</p>
<p>Oh, jolly goodage, and the dafterdillions are blooming too.</p>
<p>Did you see I transplanted some by the Willow Arch?</p>
<p>I didn’t. I don’t have my glasses on.</p>
<p>A soft, pastelly morning, slightly warm.</p>
<p>The dawn chorus a little subdued. Dampened.</p>
<p>They were up late last night at the Lazy Pheasant — birds in human
dress — Blackbird fella singing, classic beatnik sort with a beret and a
poloneck and a golden harmonica. Robin chap beside him on the fiddle,
brown jacket with grey elbow patches and a nice warm orange jumper. All
the sparrow people knocking ’em back. Inspector Heron keeping an eye on
it all from the corner, peering quietly over his brandy. The
ruddy-cheeked Magpie Priest, more chock full of sin than the lot of them
put together, thievin’ basta’d. Little Willow Warbler woman did a lovely
acapella number, surprised everyone and brought a tear to not a few
eyes. Greenfinches got in a fight again, broke a table. Aye it were a
good night, not surprised they’re all a little quiet this mornin’.</p>
<p>I spent the evening in the company of a woodlouse myself. People
don’t talk to woodlice often enough. By the time they start it’ll
probably be too little too late. Once we’d got the more mundane business
out the way, me telling him about my plans for the new lightbulb, and
him having a little moan about some rotting wood I’d thoughtlessly
tidied away, well, they really are quite remarkable
conversationalists.</p>
<p>They still remember the ocean you know? It’s a bit like talking to a
snail in that respect, only the snail carries his little piece of it
with him still, whereas the woodlouse imagines it all around him. I
never realized they spent so much time a-dreaming.</p>
<p>This fellow I was talking to, he had the same feeling as me, that at
some point in the very distant past his people had crashed into
Earthsea, and yet hadn’t properly come into being until they managed to
pull themselves up out of that and onto dry land. This is not to say
anything disparaging about fish and those type of people you understand?
We all recognise the contributions of the deeps in sustaining our
so-called reality (which is to say maintaining our imaginations, I
suppose) it’s only to talk about how it seems for sorts like us.</p>
<p>Now you <em>will</em> find a certain arrogance among the Pillbugs, they’ve
been known to say that what fish do shouldn’t properly be called
breathing, and only things that really breathe partake in being, but
opinions such as this are just the unfortunate side effect of their
people’s propensity for a more technical terminology. It just happens on
occasion that because they’re not content with calling a fin a fish-wing
they tend towards an imaginative distancing.</p>
<p>Quite right, Herr Woodlouse, it seems that way to me too: less
imaginative like that, with everybody’s foot called a different kind of
foot, until all of a sudden the apes are walking around with opposable
thumbs going on about hands instead of using the ungreed upon magination
of a feather on the end of a man-wing. That’s why even though I’m typing
I still keep my quill behind my ear, and every now and then take a
homeopathic dose of octopus ink.</p>
<p>But clearly there are advantages to it. Or have been, in the short
term? Herr Woodlouse?</p>
<p>Oh my, I do apologise, you are absolutely seething!</p>
<p>Yes, it was insensitive of me.</p>
<p>It’s been rather a disaster. But what if I mumble something about the
baby and the bathwater?</p>
<p>I’m not getting it, you say?</p>
<p>I felt so close to understanding something. Would you please help me
get back on track? Try to remind me? Tell me about the sky again. The
sky we are swimming in…</p>
<p>Tap tap crunch crunch munkle burrow. Wall wait listen listen feel
eye. Fill belly empty belly think the still. Still the think think the
still still the think. In the dark walking past wait again. On the wall
see the fellow nothing do. Many legs twice tongue head alien mouth. Body
split all together feel around. Go between the go between to woodlouse
house. See the sky we sailing through we dive into. Swimming back
swimming back to homing star. Nice and dark the rotted parts of old big
bang. Crunch it up crunch it up and pass it round, make it up and break
it down. Break on through break on through the me and you. See the them
before the birds shall language of. Listen to the shell the which of
whom your ears are. Big dishes on the earth to drink the sounds of
falling star. The sun come fizzing up and steaming out the ocean world.
The trail of cloud the path of fire the hunger to know the lost and
found. Every grain of sand sound. Colours in the dark fish. The curtains
of the seaweed part. The feathered showing of the ever celebrated
disaster stage. In this play the real actors die again. Only no one
laughing at the wingéd genius. One hundred lovely legs on either side
doing the cosmic cancancan’t. Wings the space tunnel of the walking
through. The one time you sang the song who gave the vision to you.
Under the sea that is over the sky where the strange things sing your
home song. A funny kind of story about who is a kind of who. The angelic
agreement of the silent flight. An owl to some, a great house to others,
a dead tree to me, a life raft to my people, a great trip to dream,
another home to build, an endless story to tell, a single thingle to be
told a hi bye, the toodle ooze of understanding or the knot of knowing
not. Say the language is a song and the song is of the ship and you
won’t go far wrong nor forget the odd quip. Toodle pip.</p>
<p>Yes. These walls are painted with the dust of ancient shells. Fossils
in the stones around the door. I have been here before, haven’t I, Herr
Woodlouse? And we will talk again. The soul is an ocean that songbirds
are swimming in. Birds that are not birds, and all our words descend
from them. And these words made us, somehow. We used these words to
design ourselves without knowing it. The truth of it is an imagination
first, a vision that most attempts at making sense are on the run from.
The Angels, the Aeons, they are Beings like Patterns, like poems who all
creatures are the paraphrased understandings of, and only those who curse
themselves with the not of nevermind might misunderstand it. Another
name for the Goddess of such is Miss Misunderstanding. I see again the
many blessings of Chaos. The eternal coming and goings of the light. The
many senses of that one meaningful stillness. But I can’t quite grasp
it. It is anarchy.</p>
<p>I have no choice but to let it be, but to let it be Cosmic.</p>
<p>It is the ocean of the soul, and there is an angel who is like an
alien bird fish swimming through it singing, and all senses are the
ripples of this otherwordly act who is the eternal life and immortal
death of being, the raft of the great tree in the multiversal sea…</p>
<p>And Lady Pheasant — should we call her Echo? — is searching for Her
Narcissus. Will he ever deign to join us down here at the Lazy Pheasant,
where the cockerel crows midnight and a wizard pours the pints and the
birds enjoy a lock-in and the small talk is religion and there is
science in every laugh… MC Sam Knot, babbling into the Haunted
Microphone, wishing you all a hippy sundaze, same one as manyone, wake
me up when you want to go to sleep…</p>

<h2>17:28</h2>

<p>You’re not normal, I said to her. We’d just sat up from snoozing away
Sunday lunchtime on the sofa and she was haloed by the sun who suddenly
seemed to be trying to tell us something, hair a mad haystack, little
face a witch’s brew of chthonic cuteness.</p>
<p>Neither of you are, she says to me, accidentally. Neither are you, I
mean.</p>
<p>She’s got a headache for some reason.</p>
<p>I’ll pick up the shit.</p>
<p>My hero!</p>
<p>Do you know anything about the sexual habits of woodlice, by the
way?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Don’t you have a book somewhere with that kind of stuff in it?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I miss the internet.</p>
<p>Are you missing your rabbit holes?</p>
<p>I am. So, they’re not insects, are they? Are they arthropods?</p>
<p>They’re all arthropods. They’re crustacea.</p>
<p>Yeah like crabs and stuff? Did they leave the ocean at the same time
as us? Was that our same common ancestor who did that?</p>
<p>No, they have a different coming-on-to-land story.</p>
<p>I just remembered, whales and that, they went back into the ocean
didn’t they?</p>
<p>Yes. They used to be a kind of wolf I think. Or maybe that was
dolphins and they were more like cows…</p>
<p>That’s fucking amazing. Imagine that. Evolving all the way up out of
the ocean and then going all the way back. Following some little fishy
all the way down into the deep dark underwater forests.</p>
<p>Do you want me to show you where I saw that boar’s leg?</p>
<p>I do. Who wouldn’t? You know where all the best stuff is!</p>
<hr />
<p>We weren’t sure it was a boar’s leg when we found it. Cute little
black thing with the sweetest little hoof. Maybe it was a lamb.</p>

<hr />

<p>A big flock of gulls wheeling around while I pick up shit in the sun.
The trees look like they’re wearing earrings. It’s all the hazel catkins
mostly. Woodpecker keeps laughing and it makes me laugh. I love the
sounds of the horses eating grass.</p>
<p>Boby watches me as I leave the field. He’s wondering if it’s dinner
time yet but he looks kind of lecherous. Big pink and black cock
wibbling like a naughty elephant’s nose.</p>
<p>I see Puck on a post on the way back: You wouldn’t see my bits either
mate, if I had to be a beast again, nice and tidy like you.</p>
<p>Narcissus the less lazy pheasant is wandering around on the Echoing
Green. No sign of his maybe missus.</p>
<p>A quick flash of bluejay.</p>
<p>Maybe that was it.</p>

<hr />

<h2>18:35</h2>

<p>Chou just back from checking on Agnes’ horses for her. One of them is
a little shetland pony who quite likes to bite. Chou has to put his
muzzle on to stop him eating too much grass and getting fat. The trick
with him is to put a little grass in the end of it first then he doesn’t
mind putting it on. Once it’s on and he can’t bite anymore Chou gives
him a nice big cuddle, overdoing it just enough to let him know he’s a
dick. He still likes it.</p>
<p>There are so many little things that need doing about the place. Big
stuff too. If I tried to make a plan or a list I would probably just
keel over from the weight of it. That’s the use of prophet-mode, you
see? You just say IT WILL BE DONE and leave it at that.</p>
<p>That is the plan, really. Bit by bit pace by pace don’t worry about
it. Long way to go and we’re gonna lose some socks and gain a few holes
along the path but it’s net gain all the way and we’re getting
there.</p>
<p>It’s like an old gypsy caravan broken open to the sky and all its
decoration has wiggled off to become a garden and there’s a little sign
out in front that says Growing Nowhere and the gypsies are just
something you catch a glimpse of every now and then when a shower comes
over or a rainbow pops up or a winking bird grabs a worm in just the
right way or a pair of butterflies twist together up over the
meadow.</p>
