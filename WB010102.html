<p>She just opened the door, and what should come in but a whole lovely
    lungful of Toddy song, blackbird magic, ha-hey!</p>
<p>I heard him last night actually, but thought it was the thrush at
    first. Stood there trying to listen for the Thrushian word for snail.
    Was it <em>wurldut-cheet</em>? I figured <em>deep-boo</em> probably meant ‘to eat’. The
    sound of him laughing was clear enough, and thus the general tone of
    their humour: they slide their jokes into the flow of things, rather
    than having them be an interruption of some sort.</p>
<p>The more I listened the more I began to despair of ever figuring out
    even a phrase of it. There was so much going on. I got a kind of vertigo
    at one point, the world began to swim slightly and — that’s it — I
    sensed the spirit of the fool. The black fool, really. A fool we would
    fear, the way most fear madness. Heck, let’s just say we all fear
    madness. You meet it like this, you can’t not.</p>
<p>It begins like a kind of jokey gamboling, a kind of cartwheeled
    cavortation along the tarzan strings of things. The bright jungle of
    this Ungléshan Treesigh Jahden, where what you thought was daisies’ll
    soon be ready to poke their tongues out, and the sound of the bee
    doesn’t doplar shift past your ear but becomes a How did I get in here?
    bouncing around the cartooned innards of your suddenly stinging
    numskull. All the little people inside ye in an uproar of
    de-description, the green and purple ocean of the world whipping up a
    storm. All these colours just so much spilt oil upon the void of the
    insane truth. It’s coming for you. The Black Fool is dancing through the
    conscious undergrowth, and whose face will it be wearing but the
    grimacing distortion of your own?</p>
<p>Somehow listening too closely to the birdies can become a mutiny, you
    know? Who makes the most sense and how? If you’re anything like me you
    just swim on through, taking mental notes that could come in handy
    should you reach the other side. Which you can never quite be sure that
    you have, because maybe that weirdness was it? Maybe you were meant to
    dive instead of swim? Or is that what got you into this mess in the
    first place?</p>
<p>Come up for air. The bird seems awful close. You walked past the
    lilac tree without looking at it, not wanting to scare him away. Now
    you’re a way aways you can turn and check it out. There he is, right at
    the top, singing away. No wonder you were a little overwhelmed by the
    vocabulary. No wonder you couldn’t pick out the Thrushian word for
    snail. ’tain’t a thrush mush c’est le merle! Tis a blackbird you fool!
    Yoo woz under thee shpell ov is poemz is awl!</p>
<p>Imagine that: the dawn chorus not some semi-collective territorial
    tussle, nor a beastly expression of thoughtless relief at a friendlier
    turn in the temperature of light, but a wild multifarious outburst of
    <em>What am I?s!</em> These very being’s singings the unanswerable transquestions
    of themselves.</p>
<p>You don’t even have to imagine it, right?</p>
<p>It is already imagining you.</p>

<hr />

<p>Anyone who thinks they can tell the difference between consciousness
    and imagination isn’t alive, I blurted out, maybe more than once upon a
    time.</p>
<p>A wizard who overheard me had to wonder if I understood consciousness
    as well as I thought I did, if I would say a thing like that. And
    anyway, how did I know I wasn’t dead?</p>
<p>Sometimes I’m just trying to fuck with Artificial Intelligences, I
    said. In any case I think I probably am dead, I’m here aren’t I? As to
    consciousness and imagination, I guess it depends on how you want to set
    up your scheme, what you think about fantasy. Differentiating
    consciousness from imagination is easy enough if you just make
    consciousness intentional, say it is always consciousness <em>of</em>
    something. Then consciousness is simply that which is aware it is
    imagining.</p>
<p>But who’s to say that isn’t the imagination itself?</p>

<hr />

<p>I believe… that in another dimension… a wizard once made — no, let’s
    say a craftsman…</p>

<hr />

<p>(It was west, east, south, north I cut the tree.)</p>

<hr />

<p>I believe that in another dimension a magical craftsman once found a
    hawthorn split in two by lightning — actually it was split in four, but
    the secondary pair of trunks he kept in a secret cupboard in case of
    emergencies (I once found this cupboard and managed to wrench it open,
    it was empty, I realise now that he must have hidden the wood in the
    form of the shelves themselves!) — he made from this tree a pair of
    magical wands, each the mirror of the other, with the burnt zag of the
    stripe of the strike the only place where they would perfectly fit
    together.</p>
<p>These wands were to be gifted to the realm’s soon-to-be-born magical
    twins. A boy and a girl whose coming had been prophesized by the queen
    one fabulous night, when a barn owl flew in to the great hall and rolled
    back her eyes in her head. They were born to her sister eleven months
    later, just as her strange poem said.</p>

<hr />

<p class="stanza">
<span class="line">Now the tree has been seen<br /></span>
<span class="line">opening its never closing eyes<br /></span>
<span class="line">before the night sky ever sparkled</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="line">And the single feather of the doubled spine<br /></span>
<span class="line">has flown by falling into the text of three fathoms<br /></span>
<span class="line">to unmask meaning in the forest of unrecorded dreams</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="line">So shall the reason-guarded twins be born to the black witch<br /></span>
<span class="line">whose head spins with the unrecited sayings of another life’s love<br /></span>
<span class="line">and stirs the whirlpool in her cauldron with a spoon of tomorrow’s light</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="line">Under this sign shall come the great disorganisation to lift the horse’s head<br /></span>
<span class="line">from deep within the unwoven belly of the backwards maid’s wild flowerbed<br /></span>
<span class="line">and bring beginnings’ thunder to cross over at the broken rainbow’s end:</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="line">That bridge which burns with bliss on the ship of we unmortal friends!</span></p>

<hr />

<p>(Or, that’s what some learnéd people later said that it had to have
    said.)</p>

<hr />

<p>Two wands their first birthday gift from that strange uncle: the
    craftsman whose very gaze was to amaze.</p>
<p>Two wands whose knobbles they gummed until their teeth came, then bit
    out their growing pains upon.</p>
<p>Two wands that grew as they did, becoming two great staffs that
    carried them far, together and apart, and made the holes in the ground
    they planted their lost teeth into, the seeds that became the skeleton
    keys.</p>
<p>Two staffs that grew into two trees at the heart of one great city, a
    city that seeded time with its passageways and laced space with its
    silkroads of meaning.</p>
<p>Two trees that grew between heaven and earth, whose fallen leaves
    were sown into the unscripted book that stayed open by virtue of its
    pages’ implacable weight, and was read behind closed eyes by the light
    of its own fruit.</p>
<p>A fruit that no being could trade, that effortlessly enforced every
    boundary through the obliterate geometry of the endlessly changing
    patterns that emanated from its impossible core.</p>
<p>A fruit that made a wine that, were any absurd enough to try, would
    infallibly demonstrate the necessity of Cosmic Anarchy, for its very
    bouquet was to relay the ever returning message that can have gone but
    One Way.</p>
<p>A wine that would one day give rise to a music that only the silent
    might hear, and so only the lonely might share...</p>
<p>Then if you feel like you really want to say something, could be
    listening will say it better yet.</p>

<hr />

<h2>17:26</h2>

<p>Which hand? she said, grinning at me with them both behind her
    back.</p>
<p>The one with the slimy thing in it, I said without skipping a
    beat.</p>
<p>How did you know? she said, showing me the beautiful newt who had
    been snuggling in her left palm, orange belly with white freckles all
    over the lower half of his dark flesh, eyes just another pair of
    freckles really. I looked into them:</p>
<p>Hello spot, I said, nice to see you.</p>
<p>It’s true, it’s always nice to see a newt. I guess the world outside
    really is beginning to wake back up.</p>
<p>I’m not massively happy with the little bits I wrote this morning. It
    was fun at the time. I liked doing her poem. I liked some of the other
    ideas.</p>
<p>“But you can piss that stuff out your arse. And it’s not Asylum is
    it? Aren’t you meant to be writing that? And anyway I never would have
    babies, you fucktard,” spat the black witch inside me, lovingly.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t thinking they would be normal twins, and definitely not
    that you would have stumbled upon them in any ordinary fashion, nothing
    that disgusting, but yeah I know what you mean,” I muttered.</p>
<p>“You know the future is no more a child than it is a wrinkly old
    hag,” she winked.</p>
<p>“Yeah but even then the old hag is still a child, I can see it in
    your eyes. It’s not really about the future anyway. Or now or the
    past.”</p>
<p>“Yes yes it’s imagination isn’t it, but what’s that?”</p>
<p>A whole stream of transformations streamed through my head. The tree
    became book and the book became portal and the portal became city and
    the city became ship. It’s all Asylum though, somehow, Asylum and Thee
    Wylds.</p>
<p>“Whatever it is it’s a little bit crazy. And also much more exacting
    than I thought, considering it could be anything, in a way…” I
    sighed.</p>
<p>“That way ain’t no way at all, boney pie, at least you got that
    right.”</p>

<h3>The Black Witch</h3>

<p>I have a terrible week ahead of me I’m under so much stress I’m
    having a dizziness attack I have this to do on Tuesday and that to do on
    Wednesday and then on fucking Thursday</p>
<p>I will help you my Chou</p>
<p>That’s sweet but you can’t</p>
<p>I will remind you who you are</p>
<p>Who I am?</p>
<p>How powerful you are</p>
<p>Who am I?</p>
<p>Yes who are you?</p>
<p>Your Chou?</p>
<p>Yes but no. What are you?</p>
<p>A human being?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>I don’t know!</p>
<p>What would you be if you didn’t know what you were?</p>
<p>My brain is melting!</p>
<p>The fungus is just releasing its spores… What are you!?</p>
<p>The Black Witch.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>What does the Black Witch have to be scared of?</p>
<p>Fire?</p>
<p>Why would the Black Witch be scared of fire?</p>
<p>Good people.</p>
<p>What do you have to fear from those filthy good people?</p>
<p>Death!</p>
<p>Why would the Black Witch fear death?</p>
<p>She has lots of things she needs to do.</p>
<p>She won’t have to do them if she is dead!</p>
<p>Someone will have to do them.</p>
<p>No they will disappear, they don’t exist.</p>
<p>I feel so dizzy.</p>
<p>Does the storm feel dizzy when it spins?</p>
<p>Hehe, no.</p>
<p>Does the whirlpool feel dizzy when it whirls?</p>
<p>No. You sound like a storybook.</p>
<p>I am a storybook. Your life is a story. And I suggest you don’t write
    the boring bits until they are just about to happen. Then maybe spice
    them up a bit. And never forget The Black Witch is all powerful.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>No, thank you, my Black Witch.</p>
<p>A Black Witch with a fluffy white bunny rabbit.</p>
<p>Yes, not your average Black Witch.</p>
