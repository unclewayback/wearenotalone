<h1>January 10th, 2023</h1>
<h2>09:11 (-1) Charity Farm</h2>

<p>Not the most amenabubble of writing environs. The interference goes
rather deep. One imagines sitting down soon after getting up, nothing
being asked of ones dream clean slate, no bone dust or skin fluff to
cloud impression its smooth grey surface. Ah yes, to have nothing to say
and go on saying it.</p>
<p>How beautifully un-petty. Words just a luscious gush of rain against
the window pane. I erect this transparent wall of pleasure, brittle now
but with the memory of superhot softs. I see your emotional weathers
through it, disappointed drips and blustery judgements, little indignant
clouds. It is not unlovely to look at, from the inside, but without,
without being without these picture windows.</p>
<p>Here in this room I will make the plans that please enough people to
be water off this old quack’s back, and go diagnose the lichens with
good health, the waiting rain drips with being proper reflections of reality,
their distortions the revelations of their own true shapes, thus all a
part of it. Every peace the one unpuzzle. I will stethoscope the heart
of the bush from an appropriate distance, not so close it shies away,
not so precise its location cannot be occupied. A consistent distance I
shall listen, listen for the beats between irregularities, not
themselves uniform, but… of a peace, you understand? Of a peace, neither
regular nor irregular. Here beats the heart of the bush. Lush water song
of the robin’s second opinion.</p>
<p>Yes, we agree. Meet me on the wing mirror, in the car park of
Llanthony Priory, I have some crumbs of a soon-to-be-forgotten lunch
that might require your most expert of attentions. I think the English
voted you their favourite bird — please do excuse me fellows, for not
saying Our, we are certain I have my reasons — just now one of them is
plummeting like a loose wet feather to the brown sharing floor of a
small wood outside Puckington. Are you happy to be the favourite bird of
a significant majority of a non-existent body? A make-believe mind?</p>
<p>Perhaps the only hope of coming close to existence is disidentity?
Not that you probably want to come close to something so risky! Here in
this valley that is most defiantly in Wales, where yet the people might
insist on maintaining their own borders in part by not coming down on
either side. To identify with such fuzz, young Puck, seems natural
enough, no? To ally oneself to the not even neutral of such honest
betweens that the coarse sieve of the world’s more usual words just lets
you fall on through. Just be careful, is all I’ll say, for the robot’s
heart is only ever a couple of ticks away from finding a box for you,
just like you are never more than five metres from a rat, because the
entire universe is a statistical net and bodies are too big to fit
through the gaps. I dint fat, sedz the flabby mind of yesterdodd’s moist
populiar agglomerate.</p>
<p>Halo Puck, I seed, whoda phunk dweeb finx wee our? Then we dhuz our
royal wheeze untae the sapht furr fleur.</p>
<p>The Old Chapel has become an Outdoor Learning Centre. Have a walk up
in those hills sometime, to remind yourself of how much it still needs
learning, and how much unlearning. The central technique is of course
attention. Observe, don’t rush, don’t panic when you get lost, but also
don’t try to convince yourself you’re not. Cross the bridge carefully,
for all it is a fallen log, without taking your hands from the ropes
some kind mind once strang across. One great big dark old oak still
holds on to a curly handful of the old life atop a tumbled stone wall
amongst some uneternal evergreens, where the light glints off
unreflective ferns like it would off eyes were any here.</p>
<p>Lovely to feel every twisted strand of her associal discomfort. I am
sorry it causes her stress, all this, but I love her for it.
Increasingly, but not exponentially. How could one love exponentially?
Primally, naturally. Aye. To the power of one. One that ain’t no
singleton. To be Alone in a sense to which selfishness could never
apply. So many selfish givers, helpers. So many blind beings
half-reading the un-far-off faces of uncognized pattern recognition.
Fingerprint patterns reduced to vague spirals of haunted woodgrain. What
is he sayin? The social being schemes. Thou entitious becoming. The
beckoning threat of nothing any indecent appearson cwm angree un. Some
generic handwaving about the precious particularity, becoming conscious
of its dancing form, until pentagrams start popping up in churches
again, and ones not scratched into the pews by distressive gothic loner
yooves.</p>
<p>The earth’s laughter as heavy as wet blankets upon the thick slate
rooves of non-local phunetthixxx.</p>
<p>Happy bearded conversation with your bright passing eyes. So many
lovely little churches making me want to knit my own prayers to cushion
my kneels upon. Homely sheep sheltering the unploughed brownshare
beneath another bare branched cuddle tree. Teddy bears arrayed upon the
front pew. Holy chapel of cute. How far you have to come to be called by
such cute, to troove so mignon a trove the heart will treasure forever.
Send all those crumbled grumbles to the digital compost, a waste of
hidden server’s hot breath, and keep inside the channels of ones
ever-unfolded head these furls of friendliness, arrangements of
unpresent hands whose sense does not dissipate into however many eyes.
Stumble stranger than ever upon your home, this everliving place where
one cannot live but in the sometimes of coming together, the
many-hearted star-planet setting off the crescent moon of seven ancient
yew. Eight including the new fellow. Another chapel across the road, one
more old one and two more recent ancients. The Vision mostly a name to
appropriate not an actual place to visit. One of the mind’s many
availabubble times.</p>
<p>Your bells are so dingable I could barely restrain mice elf. Your
mouse-handled font was delicious. That you turned your eyes to the hills
and saw what was not there, the more than necessary apparition of a hope
we would be insensible to want.</p>
<p>But you make it so gentle it is true.</p>
