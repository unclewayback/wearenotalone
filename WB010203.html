<h1>3rd February</h1>
<h2>07:34</h2>

<p>A spoon is more dangerous than a knife<br />
(when it comes to getting out of bed on time)</p>

<hr />

<p>A long walk ahead of me in which every step must be trod
differently. If only my foot was a million-toed piano with no black and white keys
only transparently wonkies it would be as easy as the music I can’t
play.</p>

<hr />

<p>What’s the use of having a mind sword if you can’t cut your body in
half?</p>

<hr />

<p>I know, I’ll build a robot. Out of stones. Programmed by a hundred
monkies on the beach of many worlds. All hunkered together with green
proteins. Call it my right hand man, man. Draw a face on my left hand
and tell it stories every night before we make sweet love.</p>
<p>Guess I should just make two robots. But then what if they preferred
each other? Would I watch? Or see what the ocean has to offer?</p>
<p>Something about the horizon and a transparent lover.</p>
<p>I’m sorry I thought you were a mountain range it is incredible you
are an octopus! When the mists of awareness descend hey? What else have
you been glistening to? The Cloud Music of Imaginary Meat? Maybe I can already hear it. I
wish it was louder than me. Without hurting, just comfortabubbly.</p>
<p>(Make it so Master Mice Strobe! So &amp; so mete it beats!)</p>

<hr />

<p>What matters doesn’t exist yet a yeti playing it would say you’re
it</p>

<hr />

<p>(Enable ma sheen, engage simplicity, fire up step one: zero is
plenum. All moist and reddy, sparkles and grit, lettuce cock-a-doodle do
this shit!)</p>
<p>((Hello? Uncles Raymond, Joel, Bilbo, Flavoursome Stranger, do you
read me? This is Jacques Wayback self-reporting for Dew Tea. Hello? I
think the internet’s broke. Let me try eating one of these little worlds
instead. Look, there’s two suns in this one! Okay, techno shift into
undlewater dawn chorused. I’m going under, undergoing, over, overcoming
up for air, over. Roger that. Roger this. Let’s burn the rainbow. Yes in
a minute dear, I just have a couple more unicrons to write. It means
what you want it to. Everythin kapart from that. Under &amp; in, over
&amp; out, mettaphorce bee teaming wiv dew, toodle oops.))</p>
<p>(((Oh what a horrobellum noise!)))</p>

<p>Well, bed time. been fiddling, then listened to that. can’t
witherstand the tiredness unforts. the sayings just seem tiresomely
sillage, and there ain’t no hidin the electronicad cheesage. drum sounds
awful. some other shite in there. seemed funny earlier, the cheesey
shit, and the imblanced production like it was meant to be… just seems
the mess it is now. maybe there’s no … down this road for me, only time
wastey.</p>
<p>maybe.</p>
