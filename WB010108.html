<h1>January 23rd, 2023</h1>
<h2>07:04, WB</h2>

<p>Got a mouse this morning. They had moved in during our week away. I
saw their evidences upon the cooker, the top of the dresser in the
kitchen — they had been having a good old explore. Thought it was funny,
how quickly they realized we weren’t around and became a little braver
and more adventurous in their circuits. Then I went to dig something out
the clothes basket and found a stash of Mushi’s snacks — mostly rice
and buckwheat — in a fold of my precious Grandad’s Dressing Gown.
Another layer down they had done the same in my precious Other Grandad’s
Cardigan, and this time started chewing at the wool.</p>
<p>Not on, micenheim. Get tae fuck, it’ll be. Time for a long walk, as
we say.</p>
<p>So I trapped a couple toot sweet in the kitchen, and Chou dropped
them Mouse Worlds away on her way to work. But then she left the traps
outside so I didn’t set them for a couple of nights. The night after she
dropped the first couple off I saw the flicker of a mouse-sized shadow
beneath the door I was meditating at. It must be that fellow in this trap. Well, who was in this trap,
with their little tail poking out, so I did what I tend to in such
situations and opened the door a crack, tried to scare it with my finger
towards the back so its tail was released, but it tried to escape
instead and the door snapped shut on its middle. Just uncomfortable for
it, no death. Little head and chest outside the cage, tiny wee haunches
and tail still inside.</p>
<p>Chou, find me a bucket or something!</p>
<p>What about Mushi’s Thing?</p>
<p>So that was it. The bunny carry cage, little plastic oval with a
perforated lid that opens in two halves. Popped the cage in and opened
it up, mouse dashed out and lid was shut. Two big goons cooing cuuute at
it running around the inside edge with its glittering black eyes.</p>
<p>It is a particuliarly cute specimen, in fact. A youngster. Anyway, I
shall take it for a walk down to Ever Eye Wood, some time after
meditating and feeding the birdonks, eye ixpect.</p>

<hr />

<p>I don’t know what to do with The Loss of Yesterday. Which probably
means nothing just at the moment. When I read it back yesterday, it
seemed not as wanky as it had when I couldn’t be bothered — but still
unsatisfactory. I do like threes. I shall write more antiprosaicacity in
threes. It began to touch on chaos and infinity, then wandered away
without returning</p>
<p>CHAOS AS BUFFER, INFINITY AS LIMIT</p>
<p>I see scrawled, undated, alone and naked on a blank page of my
notebook, just behind the Enigmatrix here. The sentences roughly
correspond to how those concepts have everted (through) me. Chaos first,
began to be associated with Creativity and the Goddess, a form — phorm —
of order which only <em>seems</em> disruptive, whose eruptivity is a feature not
a bug, the entire chaotic aspect being directly proportional to her
being misunderstood. Anyway, it was in the This Butterfly poem that the
mutated concept I think found its first proper voicing. It is simply the
idea of chaos as a kind of insulation, and there is a whole metaphorealm
to explore in the thinking of that word as isolation. Rather than a
chaotic system being particularly sensitive in an unbalanced fashion,
i.e. forever at a critical threshold wherein the tiniest mouse fart can
tip into cascading destruction, butterfly flap storms and such, squashed
caterpillar dinosaurs leading to radically alternate worlds etc… Chaotic
systems are rather exceedingly stable, very capable of absorbing all
kinds of apparently significant shocks. I suppose I am looking at Chaos
here more on the Cosmic Anarchic level. Chaos is a Cosmic Anar Chick.
Tweet tweet.</p>
<p>I do see that we can and do build models, and perhaps
socio-cultural-techno-structures, which are ‘vulnerable’ in the classic
fashion of some tiny adjustment cascading into a major effect, or having
a significant result. I am just not sure this translates to the Reality
I am unfamiliar with. In this world, the most major effects are a kind
of eversion of visible drasticity, and are produced upon something like
‘subjectivities’ in our encounters with what after all does not change
(nor not change). Like being stilled by some great cosmickey taking
unripple, y’dig? Much of what most take to be change, and try to produce
in terms of effects, are quite… well, impermanent, more or less. The
only ‘thing’ that makes a significant difference is the one that is
already there, mostly unnoticed.</p>
<p>Anyway, that is something of how Chaos has shifted for me. I realize
also that a similar process is or has been underway also with the
concept of information, and figure I should just read them two Gleick or
Glick or whomever books and try to make a messay on it. I know this
looks like deconstuction in a way, or could or should — but also doesn’t
and shouldn’t… deep ends on our mishundershtandinx. I am not simply
reading things backwordzzz, or being a metacontrarian, these concepts
are everting themselves through me in my attempts (but not attempts
that I, strictly speaking, am attempting) to understand them / explore
them / open to them / welcome them — with appropriately raised owlbrows.</p>
<p>Infinity has been burbling along too, but only recently kind of…
struck, like lightning, but not that time. Maybe it hasn’t quite
happened yet. Regardless, this is associated with Bozoji/Biroco, The
Dead Posters Society, his New Force and my Dead Metta Pharce</p>
<p>–shite, maditation preparation time–</p>
<p>Anyway, it is associated with Wayback. Notions of speed of light as
firmament… The whole neutrino/tachyon/unicorn trip… the way in which the
apparently boundless keeps us in our place in some seemingly exponential
fashion (powers of one?)</p>
<p>Chaos-wise, look at how same kind of instable systems as might
produce butterfly storms also produce homeostasis. Feedback isn’t just
or primarily distortive, but regulative — this is natural intellagence
inaction.</p>
<p>Chaos is Sam Knot, the infinite more Uncle Wayback — Confusion
Practice, mutant info theory… some kind of line that undivides… a life
line… the vertiginous horizon of a velly particuliar event… evert…
unvent.</p>
<p>Just sitting now, then. Forgot to get back on chatting the Gate to
Chou last night, and realizing all kinds of… more sweetly comprehensible
stuff… that somehow gets lost (intangunabled) when I sit down to try to
work it all oot sohi solo.</p>

<hr />

<h2>08:33</h2>

<p>So, nice wee session. Last night the room was quite busy, so
appreciated the quiet this morning and got quite still. Chou came in just as I
getting up at the end, asked if I had just been standing on my head, I
said No meditating, but she was just asking if I had finished with my
Unfleshy Thing, because kiss.</p>
<p>Kiss.</p>
<p>So I said Actually now that you mention it I probably should stand on
my head, and it’s not really Unfleshy by the way, in fact it is good for
the body, it kind of settles into its natural pyramid. So it is
embodied, just that’s not the focus. I think of it a bit as Putting The
Body Down. Sometimes I think of the body as just a hand — looks down at
his upturned open hand — my breath, or the blood pulsating through it,
and gravity, are the two things I listen to. So I’m just trying to
restfully put the body down, but so it stays sitting there, not like a
puddle, and in getting myself out of the way it can start to find its
good shape.</p>
<p>I thought of that, The Hand, after I said it, as The Hand of The
King. The body is a useful thing, a precious artful capable thing. Nicer
to think of it like that than meat robot.</p>
<p>But the structural engineering is beautiful too, the strings and
hydraulics of it. That is how I am thinking of his horse, a bit
like a Mech Suit, but in Horse Phorm. Based on the movements of the
body, driven by the body’s energy, just making it more powerful and
efficient in the direction of speedier transportation. So it uses clever
engineering to amplify the body’s own energy, rather than being powered
by electricity or something.</p>
<p>I recall I checked up my chackras, briefly — need to get a proper
seat as my root was hovering a bit — and felt them as vertical wheels in
line with the mirror between my right and left sides — and thought of an
advanced Chackra Bike, a kind of seven-wheeled chariot. The crown, at
the front, being the biggest — bit like, whatsitcalled, a penny
farthing? And perhaps the root at the back being twofold in a little
sprung trailing pair of almost stabilisers — but the wheels are
different sizes and tensions of suspension because the idea is that
together they hug the ground in a really effective kind of friction.</p>
<p>Anyway, so far the feeling with the rewrite of the loss of yesterday
is to somewhat preserve the original, and attempt to expand upon it as
if it might be his interruptable thought stream. So if I want to expand
upon or clarify something I should be questioned by a fairy, or distracted by
some sight or thought of my horse…</p>
<p>What was that thought?</p>
<p>The thought of the lover… can’t remember quite… it is of the flavour
that the technology — horse, hand — is the absence of and eventual
return or manifestation of his Cosmic or Eternal lover. Her presence
too then, in that sense of something like becoming.</p>
<p>It is not strictly speaking desire, more somehow the fulfillment or
perfection of such in something akin to the purity of the fool, thus
perhaps the tech is the quest and the graal, but I’m not sure this gets
me any closer to what I hoped to recover.</p>
<p>Surely it is <em>that</em> — this love — that drives it somehow, just as the
horse is driven by, is the amplification and improved efficacy of the body’s
energy — so is the ‘design’, the kind of overarch or evolution of the
process — driven by, a listening to or expression of, love.</p>
<p>A strange subtle sense of some magic of companionship — not as a
replacement for, substitute for or symptom of the lack of social
interaction or relational (human/other) fulfillment such as we might
find in the modern world… but as a ‘magic mirror’ of sorts, or a
container for that — this — Aloneness which is or could be true or total
togetherness. A fulfillment of our human gazing together into the face
of a Divine — and Created — Other which is not not our own.</p>
<p>Reminds me of a painting now, which is not what the Gate was. There
was a bit of almost New Age or Fairy Tale stuff set between carnations,
wherein the soul is in a Great Hall, a kind of Art Gallery, and each of
the pictures are portals or gates</p>
<p>— ah yes, this is the face of your lover, this is what your creative
technologies are the microshowdonttelloscope of seeing that you see —
technologies from stories to personal computers and beyond — writing, in
some quite fundamental fashion —</p>
<p>Each of the pictures are lives, worlds you can enter, trips you can
take. You won’t see everything that will happen, when you gaze into
them, not like a predetermined graphic novel of that life — a painting,
more like. The way a painting doesn’t move, but your eye does, and the
meaning can continue to unfold creatively, like paraphrased poetry —
this is akin to what is meant by stillness, and also how it
differentiates from stuckness. This is what the threshold is, this is
what a place is, and it is also what a Gate is — or The Gate. Perhaps in
a way the gallery also echoes through the knot atlas, although
not really unless we can see them aesthetically — or their
<em>potential</em>.</p>
<p>A place is like this because of the way it has a certain depth but
cannot go too far — other places are a bit like window paintings you can
see from the place you are, and/or are in. For the world to become still,
is for the Gate to begin to appear. As the world stills a bigger
picture is glimpsed, even as you are looking at just a little corner or
detail of it. It is the picture you saw on the way in, that you are
still in, that is still in you. Holographic in a way then, too, but not
literally. Not literally composed of tiny pictures of the whole, just
that no piece can be considered to exist alone, or without the whole…
and the whole is something there is no without of, not an everything
like ‘everything in this box’ could be. Not a sum, except when I am,
hawhaw. Awe knot.</p>
<p>That is also how it is like an illusion or spell, an enchantment. It
is not that you need fairies and unicorns, it is that your life, no
matter how mundane it seems to you, no matter how dreary your world — it
is like a spell you are under. Like entering a picture, or being
suspended in the undisbelief of book.</p>
<p>The Gate then, in a way, as well as being To and simply Your World
(y0ur Whirled)… is also To The Gallery, but it is something else to see
it from inside the painting. A painting.</p>
<p>It is this mode or manner of speaking I saomtimes (ok) forget whence
tall kink amonkst mice elves.</p>
<p>I said yesterday that, just as a good children’s book or film can be
and is enjoyed by adults too, so do I wish to produce a ‘normal’ work —
something more or less accessible and comprehensible, on the level of a
Good Fantasy — that is nonetheless enjoyable by weirdos. By the
profoundly weird, the fundamentally disturbed, even. Something that has
Madness in it, but is not itself insane. Something that is fiercely
intense, uncompromising, but without that ever being in an emptily
shocking or gratuitously violent way. I want the weirdness to be as
profound and necessary as it is.</p>
<p>I cannot think of other works like this. I know and love that a lot
of stuff is a bit strange in nice inclusive ways… oh, she is on the
phone…</p>
<p>I don’t know. Because I also don’t want to just go low brow, if you
know what eye meme. Anyway, a lot of the weird I find is a bit too
welcoming somehow, or else just a bit ‘let it all hang out’ or
unachieved… so it is either low brow, which term i donut loike burt thar
wego… or a kind of weird that fairy chimes with ‘Diversity’ as corporate
countermimicry or capitalist misappropriation — an <em>easy</em> weird. A
utopian one, even, but that is of course a too simple thing to say.</p>
<p>I don’t know, somehow I’ve lost the taste for some of the late night
fiercely weird that I do in fact appreciate and love. Cult stuff.</p>
<p>And I’m cynical or just unfulfilled by most of what passes for
Fantasy, or whatever.</p>
<p>I have to stay in touch, say, with my inner Urban Weirdo, but what
I’m feeling for, and forever reeling — metaphorealing — in the wake of,
is Really Wild Weirdness, expressed in an… almost Ultraterrestrially
Civilized, um, Unphashone.</p>
<p>If I’m going to fail at something, might as well be this!</p>
