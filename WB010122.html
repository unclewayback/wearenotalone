<h1>January 6th, 2023</h1>
<h2>16:51 The English Channel</h2>

<p>I guess, unless otherwise mentioned, it is WB ain tit? Home at
Winding Brook. Also quite at home on the swaying sea, it seems. It is
not nothing, this little ocean of ours.</p>
<p>I know, I know it is not an ocean. It was the swaying sea that did it
to me. Swayed me towards inaccuracy. I wonder if there is something
inherently alliterative about it? That ruffled expanse, that great
rolling surface.</p>
<p>It gets a little rocky out here, in the extensive centre.</p>
<p>The Sea King doesn’t like it when boats like ours are rude enough to
fly over his Mansions. His wife is in the garden, waving her arms at the
sky. That’s the waves.</p>
<p>We have found ourselves quite a handsome lounge. A nice little nook
with facing seats. I drifted off to sleep reading about Seely Wights. I
danced with Dolphins, sure.</p>
<p>She came and reclined—</p>
<p>Look a ganet!</p>
<p>—in the seat next to mine. After I woke up. Rested across the awkward
leather arm rest. One thread of the blue wool of her jumper seems to be
woven through the greys of mine. She wears jeans, a light, light blue
scarf. I have dark blue tweed trousers. My eyes are blue, hers grey
blue. The sky and the sea. We have dressed appropriately.</p>
<p>I think of telling her we are no ordinary family, trying to ease her
anxieties in the car on the way over. She wouldn’t spend a week with
anyone. I tell her we are mad. We only judge the judgers.</p>
<p>It echoes through my mind: we are no ordinary family. I think of us
all on our journeys. All those Safe Journeys. I wonder if we might not
be Gods?</p>
<p>I feel a steel made of these elements. A sword that sings with all
the swaying of the sea. That has a soul, that is never still — whose
very stillness, solidity… is in a thing that is not there. Not here. All
around us now, everywhere. Not there.</p>
<p>A metal made from the light that falls upon the waves. That is my
blood, my soul, the colour of my eyes, the wearing of my clothes, my
way.</p>
<p>We will have to move now. Not such a handsome lounge after all. Not
when filled with the untertaining nonsense of the cinema next door. She
has already moved. I wanted to finish a paragraph or two.</p>

<hr />

<p>(After talking about falling asleep reading, her saying how making
the whole journey tonight would not have been possible, me remembering
taking Ryan’s Mum’s car to her in Ireland, driving up to Holyhead, a
rocky drunken sleepless crossing, going through the fields in the early morning,
nodding off and waking up on my way to the ditch. Drunk driving, early one
morning after an all nighter in my early twenties, with Cat,
pulling up beside Winton Rec, knowing I’d done well to get even that
far, unable to hold the car straight, throwing the keys as far as I could
across the frosty playing field, the laughing search of the need to
sober up, some part of me only just wise enough to let the rest of me be
lucky. Another drunken moment with Ryan, giving some girl the I’m-a-Philologist shpiel, then taking her through an elaborate history of the
word Cunt, via the obligatory witchy sexiness of an Ancient Egyptian Cat
Goddess. I think he was genuinely proud of me, if only for that one night.)</p>
<p>(I’ll probably stay here, hold fort. The cinema sounds are
intermittent and these seats are too pleasant. I defended them from a
haughty disabled woman who I quickly judged as pushing around
the one who was pushing her around. He was taking her on through but
she thought she might squeeze in in our direction. I leant across to
Chou and told her we would move if we had to, but they just went on
past. That’s how I justified my evil disinclination to give up this wide
prize place: that my wife’s disability was simply invisible. And so is
Our Angel. And so is the metal that runs through my blood. That sings
with a sea between lands. A sky between night and day.)</p>
<p>(James Brown now. I can tolerate about four seconds of funky cheese
before I want to push it down the stairs. The original meaning ov
bwoken beatz.)</p>
<p>(Nearly finished my Murphys. 17:38. Another couple of hours
then.)</p>
