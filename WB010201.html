<h1>Winding Brook, 1st February 2023</h1>
<h2>07:48</h2>

<p>We shall see what the old witch has in store for us today, not
forgetting she is also a firey maiden of inspiration and part of the
constellation of Goddess whom I home make for, whom I wish this place to
welcome. It is still not ready yet, Dear Queens of Heaven, but I’m sure
you know this better than I do.</p>
<p>Dawn blushes greyly the bottom of a cloudy sky. I doubt the weather
will be bad, but it’s not looking good either, so that’s good.</p>
<p>Every time I’ve played this divination game, that I remember, it has
come out pretty maybe. Cloudy in the morning, sunny in the afternoon,
kind of thing. But me, I quite like a little uncertainty. I’d watch the
weather report just to enjoy a moderately attractive woman gazing into a
monitor in order to peer over her shoulder at something that isn’t
really there going The weather tomorrow will be maybe. The weather
tomorrow will be maybe. In this approximate location, within this
general area, tomorrow, and probably the next day and the next day — for
what else does tomorrow really mean? — the weather, more or less, will
be maybe. That’s just a probability, but at least now we can rule out
any certainty.</p>
<p>So keep yer eyes on the skies, an yer pack stuffed with supplies, an
yer mac as wholly un-hole-y as seems wise, an yurl be right as rain an
wrong as sunshine.</p>

<hr />

<p>Might have to do something about this desk of mine. It’s getting a
little crowded. Also some digital dust has been collecting in the
corners.</p>
<p>But first I need to keep delving back into what we would have been
releasing today. Autumn 22. It’s not all good. I find myself into the
flow of things, typing up stuff from the Big Red Zap Book, then later
come back to it and realize… oh, maybe it was just <em>too</em> me, not really
something it is worthwhile sharing… maybe only I, and perhaps a few few
others, could read and enjoy those bits, revisit those feelings, inhabit
that slant… sure, I am doing this for me, but not only. I am…</p>
<p>Trying, learning… it is difficult. Sometimes I just feel like I’m
preparing a bunch of stuff to be forgot, passed over… to enter the arena
of endless scroll. But fuck that voice. I know that if I do this it will
find its eyes, make its connections, reach you, and some of you will get
in touch with me, one way or another, some of you are… that’s part of
what Amulet is. Who.</p>
<p>But even so, I have to find and maintain a kind of tone for you. For
us. Sure it is for me too. I come back into something I’ve written I
don’t want to be let down by it, I don’t want not to get it, to have to
have it depend on my mood… it needs to be stronger than that. There
needs to be something there whatever anyone says or feels about it. I am
just… <em>just</em>… beginning to be able to see this stuff. It isn’t
easy for some reason. It’s not really about objectivity or seeing
yourself from the outside, or as others might.</p>
<p>It might have more to do with whatever I believe I believe, what I
think — <em>know</em> — is worthwhile or necessary. Not not in an everyday way.
It has to be constant. Some head clouds because weather is tasty, but
feet grounds because we got places to be. Also I believe in happy, in
hope. I don’t want to give you all of me any more than I want to be
that. Who wants to read a fucking moan? Not I! But I’ll drink doon yer
rage likes me fookin froat isk dry!</p>
<p>Happy never meant silly to me, because silly never became silly. I
might not be climbing no rungs worldwise, or saving me pennies or
getting officially sanctioned and qualified… but I’m up to something.
I’m up to shite. Something more interesting than I could ever plan for
slinks storywise through the worlds, and it is a story of a certain
kind. Like Earth, it has a bit of everythink in it, but, like Earth,
there is an equilibrium in this… more ecodynamis than homeostasis, or I
would’ve just sayed that. Like Air, it is born from the meeting of
extremes, and there are ways it can talk between them, but also ways
that it escapes them.</p>
<p>Stillness of fire without ash.</p>
<p>Stillness of water without ice.</p>
<p>Stillness of air without staleness.</p>
<p>Stillness of earth without not spinning.</p>
<p>Vitality of war without violence.</p>
<p>Excellence of sport without pride.</p>
<p>Beauty of art without conceit.</p>
<p>Reason of reason without repetition.</p>
<p>Gentle pointedness without end.</p>
<p>Continuity without synthesis.</p>
<p>Transformation without forgetting.</p>
<p>Discipline without force.</p>
<p>Truth itself a compromise without compromise.</p>
<p>Life, Love, and Light, without excuse or exclusion.</p>
<p>Real difficulties welcome, easy answers not, the Good Problem
preserved.</p>
<p>Perseverance without severity.</p>
<p>Yep, it all sounds good in theory!</p>
<p>But why make a litany of poetry?</p>
<p>When the chant is the heart of your heart?</p>
<p>And the heart of your heart is out there?</p>
<p>Deep down things, the old poet sings, deep down things…</p>
<hr />
<p>(To speak is to listen, and the glistening is speech.)</p>
<p>(Beware the song without words, but not the birds.)</p>
<p>(Whisper the blood into the stone, may every seat be throne.)</p>

<hr />

<p>“May every seat be throne,” is Ungléshan code for, “Have a nice
poo.”</p>
<p>We’re in the habit of letting people know what we’re up to.</p>
<p>I would quite like to put an umlaut on that U. We’ll see, don’t know
how to type it yet. Maybe a circonflex sur le ah, aussi.</p>
<p>In my Pure Land the Buddha is on the toilet, thinking. That is the
centre of my mandala. You visit as a bird or a flower. A tree, a leaf, a
blade of grass, a ball of dew, a frog or newt. A toad, a weasel, a beech
marten. A squirrel would be nice. A dormouse. A hare. A rabbit. A mouse.
A mouse. A vole. A shrew. A butterfly. A beetle beetle beetle… a breeze,
a cloud, a ray of light, a tiny patch of shadow. Salamander. Worm. The
unlist does not not go on.</p>
<p>One day you can stroll in through the front door in human form and
have a cup of tea, if you like. I will show you around. Tell you a few
stories. Send you off with a pot of jam if I have one handy.</p>
<p>This place cannot just be this place. I cannot forget this. I
actually do have a great love of and use for the literal. But for it to
exclude the truth is to blindly enter a prison. The alternative is not
mere metaphor. There is no such thing. There are bad metaphors, of
course. There <em>is</em> such a thing as a mere analogy, <em>just</em> a model.
The alternative is the Metaphoreal. It is freedom but not without
constraint. It has taxes, just like any realm. There is work to do but
you learn to love it. It is a kind of play, not without illusion but, we
believe, some ways beyond disillusion.</p>
<p>Maybe it is just what Chou said about her Mother that is making me think this.
A while back we were all looking at buying a bigger place together, some kind of Manor,
but no one thought it was a good idea. I did, Chou did. No one
else.</p>
<p>It probably depends on her mood and who she’s talking to, I
said.</p>
<p>I know, you’ve become attached to this place, said she.</p>
<p>I cannot let the work I do here, the actual physical labour, bind me
to it literally. When you have a dream, you are better off realizing that
than manifesting ‘it’. Otherwise the dream has you. These things are
not easy, not straightforward… except they are. I just mean: it seems
that we can say these things to each other but there are ways we can
only realize them for ourselves. This is one of the meanings of
Aloneness, for me at least, and why it need having nothing to do with
being apart from you. It is aside from things, though, aside from
anything else. Similar to the metaphoreal in that sense, in the relation
it bears to freedom or liberation… but these things are too high for me
to say.</p>
<p>You understand that it is because I love this place so much that I
cannot allow myself to become attached. <em>We</em> understand that. That is a
lot to understand, might even be the essence of understanding.</p>
<p>I always struggled with the idea of Man making Nature better. From
the Christian Caretaker, to the English Landscape Gardener… I can see
what you mean, it just doesn’t sit right somehow. It doesn’t sit right,
but I can come to something like it — a different kind of understanding,
more akin to compromise, and this is no bad thing — I can come to
something like it when I think of making this place a Home.</p>
<p>When we got here, it wasn’t a home. It might have been someone
else’s, once upon a time, but it wasn’t anymore. It still is, or is
again, now, in that a home for me has to include freedom for its ghosts.
Provision for its ghosts. A home is nothing without its ghosts, because
the living are nothing without their dead. Or not because, but there’s a
parallel of sorts. I don’t think it’s an analogy, it is part of the
meaning of metaphoreality (which is not not meaning itself).</p>
<p>As bare fields, perhaps the horses would call this place a kind of
home, but homes are not really their thing. Birds make homes of certain
trees, I think. I feel. It is far from unnatural for a human to make a
home. I would even rather imagine that that is what the homo in homo
sapiens referred to, instead of the same old monkey stuff. I am sorry,
but that I am a primate really doesn’t mean that much to me. I am
glad to know it, it is not unuseful information, just it was already
kind of written all over our faces…</p>
<p>Is this?</p>
<p>The process or activity of making this place a home has as much to do
with changes that come over me as any literal alterations to the
landscape. Anything that happens here is not really one or the other.
But let me be clear that this place can be taken from me, whereas my
Home can never be destroyed. It does not die even when I do. Wayback
will be Winding Brook, in the end. And a brook doesn’t begin or end,
even as it has a source and a mouth. A book doesn’t open and close, even
as it begins and ends… it doesn’t, really, does it?</p>
<p>I won’t even write my book without seeing it in the skies. In the
tracks of animals. In your unrhymed eyes. No, sorry, they rhyme. Two
doors to the same house, but the same way in and out of one Homed mind.
Saying these things — because I never just write them, even if I don’t
say them out loud — kind of makes my head spin sometimes. I guess it is
a cauldron in another dimension, and one of my jobs is still to stir
it.</p>
<p>So I will make Winding Brook online, too. We are still without the
internet here — the day is clearing up already — and I had begun to
wonder the degree to which I wanted to return to it. I still don’t know.
But I will do something with it, pay a small amount to be able to do
something appropriately minimal in my own way. But I need you guys.
Peeps.</p>
<p>I don’t, but I do.</p>
<p>I need you to carry Winding Brook too. Just if you want to, if you
wouldn’t mind… maybe we don’t have much choice in the matter… I am silly
to think of it as me or mine — I already don’t, obviously, but just as
obviously the not not is not not so tricky! It is more like a landscape
feature, sure, that is something we just have to work with or not.
Already connects us. As well as divides — it makes a really good place
to draw boundary lines. Nature doesn’t have an Outline, sure. But it is
filled with these. Maybe it is mostly them. These inside-outlines?</p>
<p>I don’t think Imagination has an Outline either. I know what you’re
saying, W.B. …but it doesn’t really.</p>
<p>Because<br />
What Is<br />
The Difference?</p>
<p>The mistake we make, or have tended to make, is to see the
imagination reduced by nature, come down to or crumble into it,
evaporate like one of its very own mirages…</p>
<p>But you go into nature (or you enter Thee Wylds, at least) and it is
the other way around: what you thought was nature, what you thought was
you, your world… it is this that disappears… and shows what cannot
appear: what is already here (and how non-literal this has to be).</p>
<p>Imagination is nature’s revelation, and this is essentially our
metaphorealization.</p>
<p>To connect this to the practise of home making, I feel must be the
meaning of FriendShip. Or a path — a portal — to it. I don’t use that
word lightly — not that one can really use it heavily (although it has a
lot of weight, to become something like that yourself). I really mean
it, in a way that I will come to understand more technically, but also
as an actual technology. The art and craft of home making. The old
wizard finally cottoning on to the ancient witch’s secrets. His wooly
old owlbrows almost bursting with butterfly.</p>
<p>Hello, old friend, it is good not to hear your voice.</p>
<p>Feel the happy trial of your smile.</p>
<p>Barely breathe a while, replenish the store with some wood pigeon
hoots.</p>
<p>Maybe they are turtle dove coos? No matter, they’re good in that
jar.</p>
<p>I would offer you a cup of tea, but I’m sure I’ve some things that
were pressing on me.</p>
<p>Just hungry birdies maybeep.</p>
<p>Time for a magic trick or two.</p>
<p>Always is, isn’t it?</p>

<hr />

<h2>10:10</h2>

<p>A few notes on our wee chat. Me and I, not thee and thou.</p>
<p>Silly sparrow already upturned the floating island. Scattered the
seedage on the floor.</p>
<p>I should focus. Have lunch to be starting. Just those few things then
Mister.</p>
<p>The difference between I and me. Us too. There really is one, and it
is far from being linguistic, although ‘there really is one’ we could
read as a ripe old pun. Some people say there is no difference between I
and me, and they think they’re being clever, think anyone else is
confused. I would pity them, were I in to such things.</p>
<p>I pity anyone who lacks non-existence. Or I would, if it couldn’t be
understood as a curse of sorts.</p>
<p>I am a bit like the home maker, and me is a bit like the house (were
a home just a house, but you know what I mean). You would look a bit
silly saying there ain’t no difference between me and my house, but I
could make you feel a little better by showing you how in truth, I am
the very home I am making. But you’ll never grasp this kind of stuff if
you go around thinking you’re cleverer than people who are confused
about the nature of I and me, and whether or not we’re different,
actually.</p>
<p>Let me tell you the real big mistake people make: saying I am. I is
not a thing that ams, excepting in notting. I is not even an other.</p>
<p>(I must read Rimbaud. I need to find that Hare again, who is not not
here.)</p>
<p>I am not, and that is that. That is all I am and the only only I am:
not. Sure, somehow this ends up knotting itself up into not not, but
that is only really a way to realize this. Me is, sure, why not. Look at
him there. There is some of his stuff. There are photos of him.</p>
<p>There are no photos of I. But there are photos I took. There are
drawings of I, and not just them done by me.</p>
<p>Some say God is I Am. I am not so sure. I think it is not, but not in
a way that is not, more like the way I am not. That there is the not not
knot. I am that I am not.</p>
<p>So there is a real difference between I and me, albeit a metaphoreal
one. I say this to make sure you don’t make the other error, which is
trying to make it less confusing by clearing it all up, the way a
grammatician would. We are not talking about language, we are languaging
thought, and thought is what I am, and I am not. You might think it is
not really a thought until it is clear. True that, but you have to
understand clarity properly. It is not without confusion. That’s why
some people just settle on thinking language kind of ad hoc, a
convenience or something. It is very far from being a convenience. Of
course that gets in there, shapes things, parts of it. Not what it is
though, is it?</p>
<p>Whatever it is, it is not. And not by some kind of semantricks or
game. What does it mean for time to prevent you from saying the same
thing twice? Nothing? What does it mean that only by time can you say
the same thing twice? Something a little puzzling? A bunch of pieces you
can take apart and put together? A figure you can figure out and pop in
a drawer and be done with it?</p>
<p>Oh it gets a little badgery, doesn’t it, for something what doesn’t
exist?</p>
<p>Sorry, me, I’ll try to do something about it. Fence the bunny in the
front garden next week. Although I’ve got a million other things I
should also do. Fucking diachronic fool.</p>
<p>Sorry if it comes off a bit wrong, chum, non-existence is somehow
best with a glint in the eyes, steam rising from a tea cup and the
sounds of an open door.</p>
<p>It can’t mean what we think it does. Just there’s no issues with it
doing what we think.</p>
<p>It’s a mood as much as anythink. A gist. Somehow that’s what meaning
really is. Not something that we can say: look at that, think of this.
The intent of the speaker is ahablaha.</p>
<p>The gist is that it is not, and this is what it really is.</p>
<p>I am an artist — not like that — not like how I am also a human bean
and there ain’t no problem there, not like I am hungry, and to say that
hunger is not is to make a nonsense of the nakedness of what actually
eats the lunch. Not that to say I am not something means that that
something must be, and in some sense be a part of me. Just that I am
not, and that is all I am, and this is not nothing, but only significant
insofar as we are in error.</p>
<p>And how could the truth ever be insignificant?</p>
<p>And yet who could say it really matters, really?</p>
<p>Unless they are being all stupid about facts?</p>
<p>Me is a fact, that I am not is the truth.</p>
<p>I am quite sure of it, without being entirely certain.</p>
<p>Potato and leek, I think.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>Probably incalcu… labley?</p>
<p>Hmn. Yesh. Okaysh. In a bit.</p>
<p>Cheers and cheeries.</p>
<p>Yes, just a crack is probably best, thanks.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>

<hr />

<h2>12:12</h2>

<p>Leek and potato, should it have been?</p>
<p>Regardless, it’s all in there.</p>
<p>Just waiting to be… neither drunk nor munched…</p>
<p>What does one do with a soup?</p>
<p>Just waiting to be spooned on in, I suppose.</p>
<p>Supped. But deeply supped, like what’s up kind of supped.</p>
<p>I sang a bit, as I stirred. Better and worse.</p>
<p>Sung The Château at Briquebec for the first time in a while. Like
that more and sing it less.</p>
<p>Did Butterfly, and managed to get myself in the right mood for
it.</p>
<p>Was thinking about Psychedelic… well, <em>meaning</em>, generally, and all we
are forever stewing on… never not psychedelic, even before I ever had a
drop or three.</p>
<p>Sorry child, it is just so very very hard to dose infinity…</p>
<p>Hehe, and how ow.</p>
<p>At one point inside my head I was shouting</p>
<p>THIS IS THE MEANING OF PSYCHEDELIC</p>
<p>NOT THAT</p>
<p>THIS</p>
<p>That the meaning of psychedelic is always performed… doesn’t it make
this so super-egalitarian that not just anyone can do it?</p>
<p>Annoying shit like that.</p>
<p>Right things you can only say by letting them be as wrong as they
are.</p>
<p>By actually being wrong.</p>
<p>Sorry, Doctor Trial Vial, that ain’t it.</p>
<p>Sorry, Mister Psy-Ee-Oh, but sure as fuck no.</p>
<p>Everything you are doing, its very psychedelichood, it depends on
this.</p>
<p>This that who does not exist. Psychedelic poetry. Psychedelic
actually. The fucking living loving of it. The Metaphoreal.</p>
<p>The only reason you have a business at all, is because cunts like me
are getting the fuck on with getting it the fuck on.</p>
<p>Even when we’re not.</p>
<p>Even especially.</p>
<p>You depend on me, without even knowing it.</p>
<p>Not that what I am doing matters. Just that you wouldn’t exist
without it. Without my not.</p>
<p>But then someones else would surely pick it up.</p>
<p>Like that indigenarse lot of whatever they’re calleds who never put
it down.</p>
<p>That might be the one sense in which it is medicine. Not yours. You
sick phux.</p>
<p>I mean that in a nice way, obviously.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>We used to know the score. Poison and cure and pharmaka caca blah
blah blah.</p>
<p>We don’t anymore.</p>
<p>It’ll probably seem like a draw.</p>
<p>It isn’t.</p>
<p>We won, and not ’cos we’re one.</p>
<p>Cos we’re not.</p>
<p>Who you callin’ lost? What you think I’m lookin’ for?</p>
<p>How could I be? I haven’t gone anywhere.</p>
<p>I feel like I should stop making my cuntdom so obvious.</p>
<p>I would if there was anyone to hide it from.</p>
<p>Anyone <em>worth</em> hiding it from.</p>
<p>Yeah, you, you cunt.</p>

<hr />

<h2>12:56</h2>

<p>She’s settled into a good solid frown. Not too heavy, but definitely
a frown. That’s good I’d say. Nice and opaque. We don’t want to shine it
all out too early. Now is a frown. Light is a dream of the future.</p>
<p>What was it you wanted to know about shine? twinkled all the other
suns in the black torchbeam of our sleepwalking.</p>
<p>Can you remember what it was you thought you said?</p>
<p>It feels like there’s a reason not to be scared.</p>
<p>For sure there are many reasons to be frightened, but there’s a
reason not to be scared and it’s more than the lot of them.</p>
<p>Beneath whatever it is we think we are is a kind of make believe we
can’t make up. And it can’t be taken apart.</p>
<p>It’s got to be next to nothing but it’s already too much.</p>
<p>The reason not to be scared is what we have to be scared of.</p>

<hr />

<h2>14:04</h2>

<p>The sun is coming out.</p>
<p>Then it’s not.</p>
<p>Then it is again.</p>
