<h1>20th February</h1>
<h2>07:22</h2>

<p>Heard Fox, early this morning, just a sentence or two of that
slightly strangled tongue, strange and high-pitched. Enough to see a mad
glistening grin in the dark of my mind, twinkling martian eyes peering through a
theatrical fox mask.</p>
<p>It has been a long time. Maybe seven years since I last saw them
here. There was the interlude with that vixen who pulled me in a fugue
state to her roadside corpse. Her coat hung around a while, bounced off
Little Odin’s presence to work some magick in my soul. But no living fox
physically present.</p>
<p>Not since the one we used to see in the early morning light that
summer, hunting in the long grass, delighting me with its great high
pounce, something I’d never seen an urban fox do. I guess I’d never seen
them hunt, only scavenge.</p>
<p>Gave me a poem.</p>

<hr />

<p class="stanza">
<span class="line">The way you question the house,<br /></span>
<span class="line">I have questioned the woods.<br /></span>
<span class="line">I too have sniffed the air<br /></span>
<span class="line">and stretched my neck to peer<br /></span>
<span class="line">into the calling place with a gaze<br /></span>
<span class="line">that became my body.</span></p>

<p class="stanza">
<span class="line">Your face! — between us<br /></span>
<span class="line">a broken bridge over which<br /></span>
<span class="line">something nonetheless<br /></span>
<span class="line">comes to pass.</span></p>

<p class="stanza">
<span class="line">And now I’m smiling!<br /></span>
<span class="line">I never saw you<br /></span>
<span class="line">pounce like that into<br /></span>
<span class="line">bin bag or kebab box!<br /></span>
<span class="line">I never saw your tail<br /></span>
<span class="line">so perfectly calligraphic of…</span></p>

<p class="stanza">
<span class="line">Not-Fox. You’ve been<br /></span>
<span class="line">a different creature, painted<br /></span>
<span class="line">orange sodium shadow<br /></span>
<span class="line">of yourself, bent towards night dog,<br /></span>
<span class="line">sad surprise deprived ghost.</span></p>

<p class="stanza">
<span class="line">Here you are more real, shockingly<br /></span>
<span class="line">even more a spirit: you take reality<br /></span>
<span class="line">and run with it, sly sight magnet,<br /></span>
<span class="line">form enlivened talkative silence.<br /></span>
<span class="line">Name no one else can say.</span></p>

<hr />

<p>I find myself wondering if it isn’t time to try to write that little
story, the one I thought could be called Our God Is Fox. Or something
like that.</p>
<p>An adventure Mushishi the bunny has. Had.</p>
<p>To challenge myself to take this somewhere else a little while. Risk
a failure, but guarantee myself a few gulps of fresh air. Find one of
those places where I’m not, to lie down and disappear for a while.
Become the beasts of an imaginary God. Or the reality of its
imagination. <em>A</em> reality, another facet of its infinite truth.</p>
<p>Sounds good in theory. A bit overblown. Do you think you’ll manage
it?</p>
<p>I don’t know. It’s happening though. Let me have a look at the
calender. I’ll do it for Lent. I have a structure in mind, although I
want to leave all the details in this muttering uncertain cloud I can
feel uncrowding the edges of my world. Wait…</p>
<p>Lent starts on Wednesday the 22nd — Cendres — that’s got to be Ash
Wednesday and that’s what that means right? Tomorrow must be Shrove
Tuesday. St Félix. I asked Chou to make me pancakes yesterday. My cream
runs out tomorrow. No coffee, no dairy, no meat, and maybe even no
gluten. Go easy on Sundays if you must.</p>
<p>Wednesday to Sunday you can introduce… let Mushi introduce himself
and set things up. Then you have four weeks which can correspond to four
nights. His first little set of escapades, that will end with his first
broken leg. Then you have five days to conclude it, before April
Fool’s.</p>
<p>I’ll meditate every day and do a little routine for my body. I have
too much belly at the moment and my back has been stiff. I’ll start work
upstairs again, as well, just little by little screwing some
plasterboard up.</p>
<p>From April Fool’s until Easter I will write a week of entries that can
come at the start of this section of Diary, Winter 2022. I don’t yet
know whether I will make it generally available but I will comb back
through it and put it together as the ebook I was thinking, even if it
ends up being just for me and you. Maybe I’ll do two, a raw
unexpurgiated one, and a <em>selections from</em>.</p>
<p>After Easter, soon enough, I expect Cuckoo will announce the real
meta-calendrical Fool’s Day, whereupon I will begin stage two of The
Cuckoo Working, codenamed Imaginary Council.</p>
<p>I might restrict myself to my notebook for that, and only writing
when Cuckoo calls. That should take us up to Solstice, thereabouts, and
I’ll start another round of this then, I guess.</p>
<p>Breaking Convention will happen in the midst of this Cuckoo Working,
near the start, I mean, and I might take some notes on that, regardless
of cuckoo or not, because the book I’ll be working in has the same
Labyrinth they chose for their logo on its cover. We’ll see.</p>
<p>So that’s the program. I’ll try to stick to it. Would be nice to have
a simple website up by Beltane, and the first installment of the diary
finished by then.</p>

<hr />

<p>A wee while after hearing Fox this morning, Little Owl hooted hello
in a half dream. Sat on one of the posts in the misty blue dawn, out
front. I came around the corner and saw it there with its back to me,
and then Chou followed. I motioned to her to be slow and quiet and as
she came it turned around to look at us, swivelled its little head,
blinked its big bright eyes and gave a cute little hoot before flying
away.</p>

<hr />

<p>Oh yeah, just while I’m thinking of it: I think that big black cat —
something hit me when I read that back — I called it a seed. It made me
think of the Datura seeds. It might have been her. I had those two spiky
pods hanging upside down in the woodshed. I brought one inside because
it had opened and the seeds looked slightly mouldy. They were lying on
my desk here, and when we got back from our holiday in January I saw
that a mouse had been eating them. I think they like to get high. They
ate all my tobacco seeds one year too, little addicts.</p>
<p>It might be connected to her then, the big black cat. I mentioned
the mummified cat we found in the barn to Chou the other day and she
said it was a dream she had that made us bury her. I’d forgotten that.
For a long time we knew there was a mummified cat up there but we did
nothing about it. Then Chou had a dream where she was at a sort of
taxidermy museum near the coast some place, and somehow the dead animals
managed to communicate to her that they weren’t happy, they’d been
wronged somehow and wanted her to bury them. So it was after that I
buried Mummy Cat.</p>
<p>I don’t plan to ingest the Datura or anything, at most I would
perhaps taste a little smoke. I’ve done this once before and it was
enough to give me a quick vision. There was this cool gothic witch girl,
like out of that movie The Craft, and she was — we were around a fire or
something and she was talking to me, trying to tempt me away from my
girlfriend somehow. Not ineffectively, I could feel the pull of it. She
was sexy, I was tempted. Cat wasn’t very happy when I told her about
that. I was being a bit silly or flippant about it I suppose, I don’t
know. It’s quite serious stuff though, and she was better at seeing
that, I think, than me.</p>
<p>I have a different relationship to darkness now, to black stuff. I
don’t completely understand it and it does sometimes terrify me but I
don’t think it would tempt me anymore. I think we must have some kind of
an arrangement on some level. It is definitely connected to learning,
knowledge. I don’t know. No definitely. Apart from that it feels much
different from how it used to. There is more of an acknowledgement than
an attraction, I could say.</p>
<p>There was one plant growing next to the house here — they both came
up late, of their own accord, and only managed to complete a cycle
because of the warm autumn we had — and a bigger more mature one behind
the shit heap. Also at the shit heap we had a random poisonous pumpkin
arrive. Don’t know where it came from but gave a variety of tiny
decorative inedible pumpkins. Very pretty and very witchy.</p>
<p>Good gourde.</p>

<hr />

<h2>12:44</h2>

<p>When I popped out earlier I spotted the ceramic cooking dish I’d
roasted some pork in. Picked up a joint that had gone off the day before
at the farm shop on Saturday.</p>
<p>Chou had said, You better put that outside see if any rats want to
lick it.</p>
<p>I laughed and did just that.</p>
<p>I wonder if that wasn’t what Old Foxy was on about this morning? The
middle of the dish has been licked out. That would be nice if it were
they who found the offering!</p>

<hr />

<h2>17:28</h2>

<p>Still wasting a bit of time and energy in areas that I’m not quite
ready to just jack in or leave behind.</p>
<p>Computer music, sometimes just hack away at a shite thing far too
long.</p>
<p>Also I don’t feel massively inspired by work flow or manner of
working of most DAWs — batwag has some fun and slick stuff but…</p>
<p>I mean, this is one of the ways I’m wasting.</p>
<p>Just watch it, is the answer, do it.</p>
<p>Every fuck up or whatever is an opportunity to not blah blah
blah.</p>
<p>There is much in this log I want to leave well behind.</p>
<p>I want nothing to do with either side of any so-called culture wars,
nor do I want to purvey some half-baked philosophy.</p>
<p>I don’t want to do much, let alone too much. Just breathe, garden,
work here, and concentrate the best into things worth putting out, worth
coming back to, returning to, not for human consumption.</p>
<p>You’ll remember it all right? You don’t need to make some sort of
list of mistakes-not-to-make? You are probably right that that would be
one of them.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that though. It was:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>keep chipping away at Pure Data, being able to do things your way is
a worthwhile goal, just don’t get lost in it again.</li>
<li>do Sunday Underwaters, sure, but just play to the dawn chorus — no
beats, just keys and use your voice if you want but probably not to
read, just to texture, no bpm or any of that.</li>
<li>do word salady fun weird word stuff, either pure voice — defo try
that — or with beats, around 90 bpm.</li>
<li>try some short little songs andor decorated poems.</li>
<li>you have ideas you should focus on and implement, like you were
thinking earlier of trying to swing from one rhythm to another using a
melody to weight on one part of it, anchor, while the other bit changed
— your Pure Data system should be experimental fun, but you should try
implementing experimental ideas in this manner, not just fiddling about
‘discovering’ stuff.</li>
<li>you really feel it is not to your benefit — or anyone else’s — that
you get involved in whatever the world currently imagines its or someone
else’s problem is… it doesn’t work somehow. so just to work from what you
love, and rage on, into the… kind of stuff that doesn’t jar. that fits
with frogs and birdsong and art and treeality. i dunno.</li>
<li>you’ll be fine, you’re just saying get on with it, and there is
plenty worth getting on with for all the rough patches or bits that
might not work.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2>22:13</h2>

<p>Okay well that works.</p>
<p>Just forget your twenty minute fiddle epic with about 30 seconds of
definite good bits and sing a random bunny rabbit song for too long
instead.</p>
<p>It’s a bunny unny rabbit!</p>
