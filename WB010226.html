<h1>27th February</h1>
<h2>08:22</h2>

<p>Sometime in the night a perfect little row of thought stands up.</p>
<p>No matter how long I lie in bed this morning I can’t find it.</p>
<p>For some days the eastern wind has been blowing.</p>
<p>Spring begins with a flush of excitement, but this always happens, or
has the past few years: the wind changes.</p>
<p>It is a killer wind. Dry cold and deathly. No body’s friend.</p>
<p>I get it, I tell it, you are no body’s friend. It comes and rips the
panels from the new greenhouse roof. Looks like the screws I used were
just that bit too short. I’ll fix the fucking thing.</p>
<p>This body too. You fucking thing. Will I fix you?</p>
<p>My intercostal tear comes back to haunt me whenever I do just that
little bit too much. It never used to be too much, so I don’t even
realize I’m doing it. But then that evening I’ll start feeling it, and
the next day it will complain about even holding me straight.</p>
<p>We’ve been planting new posts of yellow willow in Happy Valley. Big
ones because we want to pollard them above the horse’s heads. I pollard
some existing ones, chop off their heads with the chainsaw. Take some
pussy willow down to the ground so it doesn’t eat up the space. Tidy it
all into piles. Then we dig the holes, a spade and a half deep, and I
drag the beasts down the hill ready to erect. They’re too long anyway so
we cut a metre of so off their bottoms. Maybe it was that.</p>
<p>Maybe it was lugging the big blue water can from the pond to the
horse’s watering trough. What is it? Twenty-five or thirty litres? Enough anyway.
Enough to carry across the yard and lift up to the edge of the trough
and pour in. And again, again, again.</p>
<p>I need to get smarter and stronger. I need to work on my core
strength. Maybe I shouldn’t be fasting but I am now. We’ll get a pump, a
new trough and put it near the pond. She kills herself bending down to
fill watering cans all summer. I will work on the firewood slowly and
steadily throughout the year. I will finish upstairs… somehow. Somehow
dig the paths and fill them with stones and cover them in wheelbarrows
full of gravel. Somehow fit out the ruin with a platform. Do all the
joining on the three sides of the house that still need it, then do the
barn. Open that door in its wall. Knock down and rebuild the breezeblock
lean-to that houses the bathroom and utility room. Build a couple of
huts. Yeah no probs.</p>
<p>Not even angry enough to write this properly. Not raging. More
annoyed with… and disappointed in… and.</p>
<p>A good opportunity to get on with practise.</p>
<p>I don’t like that either.</p>
<p>But it’s like a tree. It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>None of this does. That doesn’t have to be a bad thing to say. A
being defeated or a having given up. There is something in it that needs
to be accepted. None of it matters.</p>
<p>If something ends up mattering, you’ll hear about it. I’ll let you
know.</p>
<p>Why even? If you can’t? Change. Or wait for something else to.</p>
<p>And don’t.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Maybeep.</p>
<p>See you on the other side, I’ll write, then realize you already were
and I wasn’t. I’m sorry, I wasn’t practising here. My own thing, the
thing that would make this matter. I wasn’t talking to you. The truth is
I’ve nothing to say to you at the minute. I don’t know what to do regarding
you and these kinds of struggles. It would be better to start like this
though. I said it, you see, I said something about feeling or knowing
certain things before I opened this word sluice, and, but… I didn’t
properly take it in. That’s the sillier side of silliness. It is already
time for me to look back at what I have here and make an effort to
remember what I said that matters, that is useful, that is — or could be
— me teaching myself. I’m so tired! I’m sorry.</p>
<p>I’ve got another big chunk of world, of place-berg, to collide with
and shift. I’m closer but the wall has gotten thicker. I’m quite cold.
There are some uncomfortable parts of my body and blockages in various
areas of my system.</p>
<p>I can almost warm myself, thinking of you, but not quite. I shouldn’t
confuse myself here. It’s an actual position I need to be in, a very
complex and multivalent posture — it’s not just my body I mean, I need
to manoeuver my soul into position, into its proper attitude, the body
is just part of that. This is all my end. It has to be. But then I need
something other than me to listen to. Breath almost works. I need an
image of you. Or multiple icons. I’m the one who has to understand them,
the one they have to work for. But it’s this, it’s here… this is the
reason for doing something I share with others. Making something matter.
It’s a way of catching something in myself, holding myself to
something.</p>
<p>Is it? I don’t know. It could be but it could not be. It isn’t
primary. It is too literal to be.</p>
<p>I think I can feel what I need to try to do more. I’m looking at the
big black book with the wheel on the front. It wasn’t what I was
thinking and yet it is.</p>
<p>Wheel ready hear.</p>
<p>Shweet.</p>
<p>Merci.</p>
<p>One mind, one love, kisses.</p>
