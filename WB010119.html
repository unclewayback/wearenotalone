<h1>January 9th, 2023</h1>
<h2>09:31 (-1 local) Charity Farm</h2>

<p>A skull here, a jawbone there. A piece of green spine, porous algae
brushed dot in the exclamation mark of the mountain’s Get A Backbone.
The ribcage broken out from, a monument to who-knows-what’s freedom. A
clustering of leg bones, as if seed scattered by a great hand upon the
pony-haunted steepness. It could be one sheep all this. The hidden sun
the ramming home of his penis in the post-death act that birthed her who
birthed him. Wind in your right temple like the wrong hand. Icy grip
that has you grin in the vicinity of its lethality. Knowing you will not
overexpose the imaginative photon graph of yourself. Quantum
scribblings.</p>
<p>Down there is The Vision. I had assumed it was a good one, but the
unbeautiful cluster of corrugated roofs suggest it could be a vision of
hell. They looked red to her, the black mountains. Yes, I said, but it
is red on black. The wind was of Thee Wylds. The vegetation was a
treacherous patchwork of clues as to the wearer of such a strangely
lovely coat. Growing fur coat unseperate from what must be a Black
Mountain skin. Is England an opening in her dress, a gentle, sensual
invitation to a seeing of her softer face — or is she someone else? I
feel her move from one place, one state, to another. Sense the shrugging
on and off of what for most is moveless.</p>
<p>The unbetween of bracken and bilberry. So clear the change,
accordment with what we call altitude, but is a cluster of feelings, a
cluster of feelings which is a sense in itself, not transcoded into a
certain, or somewhat certain, number of categories. Cold is cold not a
kind of touch. The wind is not a skin. What is the wet? Clear vision,
musical tickling of the grasses of your inner ear? Your inside outer
here? It is clear the change, clear to the mind, and just as clear is
its jitter and jag, the fuzzy unproximations of the two world’s
unbetween. It is a line.</p>
<p>And they are lines that the sheep walk. They cannot make these
contours, but they wouldn’t be there were they not brought on out.
Nature has no outline, but this is the supernatural itself. The lines
are clear enough to me. Who perceives they have been taught to perceive,
and then taught to realize that I see what I cannot see, that what is is
the being that cannot be, but who I am we</p>
<p>our reality, which is not this, nothing we make of it, rather the
imagination of what is really there, which must trans… oon… transoon…
to… who is really here. She is just distracted at the moment, by all
these voices that cannot become the unwhisper of the rivulets that
untemperately tickle her self-knowing love. The translucent hair</p>
<p>(Look at the size of those fucking bananas! — my first full sentence,
in the midst of the supermarket, white blond hair in angel curls,
milking a sour That’s Disgusting! out some humourless un-hag)</p>
<p>The translucent hair of her I am standing to attention for the
lightening clear unstrike of the revelation of what ever must have
stroke, these lines of the evident impossible I wish to Goddess, I love
to Lady, I de-serve to storm and to stone, to suit my armour to whatever
wetness shines, to cut like these lines, and to so and so as they do,
holy naughty.</p>
