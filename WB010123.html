<p>Goes to put his coffee on, clacks up the stove and the fire shoots
all wonky out the side.</p>
<p>“How does everythin’ end up wonky ’ere?”</p>
<p>He turns off the fire, corrects the little round top-plate, and gets
it going again.</p>
<p>“But it doesn’t end up wonky, does it? Cos you unwonk it don’t you
Wayback?”</p>
<p>Then, while inserting the proper punctuation above, the coffee boils.
He gets there just in time to see it fountinate out the percolator,
adding some more fetching brown flecks to the wall.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t start off wonky neither mind.”</p>

<hr />

<p>“It is the penultimate day.”</p>
<p>“Pardon Chou? The Penultimate Day? Sounds like a movie doesn’t it Mushi?”</p>

<hr />

<p>“Drink yer fuckin’ coffee, Mister Nonsense,” he says, then, wandering
off, thinks: <em>that could be the title for a song…</em></p>

<hr />

<p>I suppose I should wrap the presents?</p>
<p>We shall see, let’s not make a to do of the to do list!</p>
<p>Will have to be newspaper, I guess.</p>

<hr />

<p>Off to do some fencing. (Of the willow post variety,
though maybe a touch of touché with the wifey, one day. Archery is
already on the cards, after all. Let’s go full medieval, why not? An
enlightened dark ages!)</p>

<hr />

<h2>12:09</h2>

<p>Nice little bit of workage. Got quite warm actually. Put posts in all
down the northern hedge of Adam’s Field. The line of them widens a bit
towards the bottom, but I let that happen as thought it made sense. In
terms of perspective and also in terms of getting woodier as we lead
down to that nice patch of wood there.</p>
<p>Chou came and waved at one point and we shouted
incomprehensibilities across the field at each other, the general gist
being “I’m going in now” from her, followed by “I come soon” from me
(both signed off with obligatory cutesy heart-shaped arm-semaphore, of course).</p>
<p>Anyway, it made me think: first of the walkie-talkies that
Rémi gave us — not sure where they are, and she would probably forget to
carry hers anyway, or lose it if she did — then, of The Gong.</p>
<p>Actually, I thought about Gong, the band, too, as my books are
waiting for me in England. It was a small murmuration of starlings that
made me think of that.</p>
<p>I thought about having a nice big Gong up in the attic, that could be
struck for lunch and stuff, as well as more transcendent porpoises, and
would sound out all across the land. I want a Gong. I want to find the
Great French Gong Shop and go sound bathing until I find the perfect
friend. But we’ll see. I’ll make do with what exists, I guess, as
usual.</p>
<p>(Thank fuck for the odd non-existent unusual, eh?)</p>
<p>I also want a nice brass bell for the gatepost.</p>
<p>Not unreasonable wants. They might happen one day.</p>
<p>I also thought — ah yeah, that seemed funny: “I’m not a content creator,
I’m a <em>content</em> creator.” Was thinking of doing videos, see. Doing some
mundane ones, like, “Equipment” — shot of me gurnin at ye, close up on
me face, then close up on me hand on me equipment, thrustin it in yer
general d-rection…</p>
<p>So, the idea is, that most of my equipment is not The Latest Stuff
(tm, must figure out how to do superscript). But it works. I’m happy
with it. Because I’m a content, creator, not a Content Creator, y
see?</p>
<p>Will try to use fediverse stuff for the full works, and put little
cut down versions on YouTube, like adverts for a place where advertising
doesn’t exist, and yet you can still find whatever yer lookin for, just
have to pass through the inconvenience gate.</p>
<p>Or did you do that already?</p>
<p>It is rather inconvenient, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Life.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t have it any other way though, would we?</p>
<p>Would we?!</p>
<p>Fuck yuz. Ya winkaz.</p>
<p>(OK Sam, go slice some onions.)</p>

<hr />

<h2>12:40</h2>

<p>Oh yeah! — nearly forgot I was in a cloud of long-tailed tits —
surrounded by their tiny high frequency chirrups — I love those birds so
much. They were in the hedge as I was planting posts — going up and down
the little willow branches pecking at the invisible. I thought there
were about five or six at first, then they started flying off past me
and there must have been fifteen or twenty. Felt blessed when the last
one flew right over my head.</p>
<p>What was that other blesséd thing? Ah yes: bluetit on the way down
the path with a seed in his mouth but quite far from the feeder, and
conspicuous, as if to say Thanks. I thought: it doesn’t matter if that’s
not true I’m just pleased that’s the way it sometimes seems.</p>
<p>Incredible really, to live in a world that seems to reciprocate ones
gratitude. In a more-than-human world that seems to reciprocate ones
gratitude, I mean. Of course humans say thanks. And thanks for saying
thanks for saying thanks…</p>
<p>It was cute thing, that reminded me of cute thing. Mushi, little monk
with his begging bowl making himself as conspicuous as possible.
Impatient little imp, imagining he can somehow cook pasta faster just by
cuting at it.</p>
<p>My pasta will be mushy, she says. She is right. I just wanted to
say</p>
<p>Bell Tower</p>
<p>and something about how we all know that really it is the usual that
is non-existent. At least, we do if we’re weirdos. But I said the
non-existent unusual because it is equally true from the point of view
of the impossible. What do you mean everything is? I should eat. Perhaps
I’m manic. Was just trying to share a joke among myselves but at this
rate I’ll be dead before the punchline.</p>
