</p>

<p>I have drip music, hitting the stone shelf just behind and to the
right of me. The window bays upstairs, being thinner than the rest of
the wall, appear to be letting water through. The lime up there, packed
with hemp for insulation, is molding.</p>
<p>Chou is on the phone… Lady Windingbrook is on the phone to the phone
company. We have a new internet box being delivered to Picauville
sometime today or tomorrow — it is Monday — but the damage to the phone
line and the plugs is more extensive, and potentially more expensive.
The box which sits against the outer wall of the house, where the line
connects up, has exploded right off. The Lady continues to reprimand
herself for not unplugging it all during the storm, as she normally
would, and had thought to do, but in the event she merely turned it off instead.</p>
<p>“My flemme will cost us.” she says.</p>
<p>“Stop looping on it now, please,” he responds.</p>
<p>Clearly my family drove me absolutely mental (bless us every one) and
I am still settling down to what I can see is another kind of mental. It
wasn’t them, really, nor her, nor me — it was the combination that
would’ve been deadly, given another week. Or, who knows, maybe we would
have had a breakthrough?</p>
<p>Just kidding. There’s nothing to break and we’re all through and
through what we already are.</p>
<p>It was that night that did it. I was woken from deep sleep, and
likely strange dreams, by the ghostly figure of Lady Windingbrook at the
foot of the bed, in front of the big picture window with the black ridge
beyond, weeping eerily. She had been trying to keep it quiet so it
amped up when I went to her and put my arms around her, shaking and
wailing with a quiet intensity. I just held her for a while until the
question of what was going on became too much for me and I asked her if
she’d had some bad news or had experienced a terrible nightmare.</p>
<p>“The hairdryer” she blurted, between sobs.</p>
<p>“What? My darling, I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>“The tumbledryer the tumbledryer!”</p>
<p>It had been the straw that broke the camel’s back. I could hear it
now, beneath us, tumbling around with its clack clack clack. I was
somewhat taken aback, she had seemed to me so totally grieving that
the disparity between her reaction and the cause suddenly seemed too
great. She sensed this and told me she was not putting on a show, if
there had been anywhere to escape to she would have made her release
there. She was trapped in this little room. Trapped with the smell of my
Mother’s cigarette smoke wafting up the stairs, the sound of people
doing late night washing down below, and the garrulous voices of game
players just the other side of a curtain they often left open, which she
had to pass on her way to what had been billed as her very own loo —
nature calls more than once a night for some — and when she got there:
it had no lock, and no curtains, and if she could hear them then surely
they were listening to her pee?</p>
<p>My poor frazzled sweet. It would be enough for most quiet people
staying with their spouse’s family, but for someone with full on
Asperger's who manages it mostly with recourse to a proper safe space, a
sanctuary whose boundaries she can mostly regulate herself… it was
just too much.</p>
<p>We wouldn’t have been in that room to begin with, had everything gone
to plan. One of my first actions was to survey the bedroom plans and
request — ok bagsy — the one that seemed most suitable: the log shed
bedroom, billed as being a little away from it all in “blissful seclusion”. But when we
arrived, a day after everyone else, the first thing mum said was that our bedroom was taken, and that we had two imperfect solutions to
choose from. In the event we, or I, probably chose the wrong one: I
imagined people would spend their evenings in the big cinema barn,
rather than on the table outside the curtain to our room.</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s how we ended up in a very unsuitable bedroom. Our
choice had been taken by my sister and her family, who mum painted as
arriving in some kind of total fluster, giving them that room being
the only thing that would calm them down.</p>
<p>The next morning I asked my sister to please not use the machines
late in the evening, as it kept us awake. Perhaps there was more energy
behind it than that of a simple request: I expect she saw the
indignation in my pointed eyes as well as the quiet aversion of my
wife’s. She said mumma’s sometimes forget these things, sorry, and
of course I was free to turn it off. Ah yes, I thought, what better
excuse for anything than having a blimming baby?</p>
<p>It was that day, I believe, that we were all due to do the Four
Waterfalls walk. Mum called a meeting and said that a three hour round
trip with the dogs in the car was too much for her, seeing as they would
have a big drive tomorrow, so she was going to find somewhere closer to
take them for a walk. Soon enough everyone but me and the wife had
signed up.</p>
<p>I likely came across as exasperated as I was when the blurb
about the paths was read out again, with the emphasis firmly on the undoable.
“There is a wide and easy path for everyone,” I said, “and the difficult
path you are talking about is closed because they cannot be liable for
accidents, so you walk it at your own risk if you want to get closer to
the waterfalls. It is for the adventurous.”</p>
<p>“Oooh adventurers!” cooed my brother and my mum sarcastically.</p>
<p>Another reason they didn’t want to come might have been the news
about a couple whose bodies had been found floating in the river just a
few days before.</p>
<p>“It says here they were thrill seekers.”</p>

<hr />

<p>So off we went, me and her. Took the fast road through Abergavenny
and on. It was filled with roadworks, badly signposted as a consequence,
and the weather and the scenery were grim.</p>
<p>The waterfalls were great though. They had looked like gentle
autumnal fairy flows in the pictures. After all these rains they were
roaring brown behemoths, messy and turbulent wild cascades of urgent
water.</p>
<p>We sat by the second one to eat. The roar was loud enough to make it
hard to speak. I thought how interesting it was that this loud but
natural sound was somewhat soothing, whereas the quiet cyclic clacking of a
tumbledryer or the voices of people a room or two away could feel so
intrusive and disruptive. It is clearly not merely a matter of volume.</p>
<p>After a while I became aware I could feel the rock that I was sitting
on vibrating through my buttocks and my legs. If I tried to analyse or otherwise
be certain of the sensation it tended to disappear. The entire soundscape was
a beautifully complex spread of frequencies weighted toward the
lower end: the noise the same colour as the water. Anything
but noise really, it seemed all signal to me. It was the sound of what
was there, the song of the river after heavy rains playing the shape of
the gorge.</p>

<hr />

<h2>09:44</h2>

<p>Just been feeding birds, getting wood in, emptying buckets, taking
photos of the lightning damage for the phone people. We’ve lost our
Hawthorn, too. I knew it wouldn’t last forever but was still a surprise
to see it down. Small murmur of Starlings came and dressed it. I went
for a closer inspection: it has been riven in two, torn straight through
its somewhat rotten middle. Will change our southern aspect
significantly.</p>
<p>I moved the Salvia closer together, to hopefully catch the drips.
Pulled off a load of her more sorry-looking leaves.</p>
<p>The fire is lit. The bunny, perfect, sat in his tartan basket with
his nose wiggling.</p>
<p>Well then, the Four Waterfalls…</p>

<hr />

<p>The sun came out, while we were sat on the subsonic rocks. Really quite
marvelous, the revelation of the moss and fern, the fizzing green and
ginger that just moments before had been a dull blue grey. Some light fell into the water,
making the brown just that little bit brassier.</p>
<p>We went on from the second past the third of the waterfalls and on to the main event.
The fourth was truly fierce. There seemed no way to get to it, let alone walk behind it as the people in the photos online had seemed to,
but then I spied a small ledge of dropped rocks along the vertical bank,
figuring that between those rocks and my wellies we could at least get a
closer look. I stood in the shallows and held her hand while she
stepping-stoned along. We were buffeted every now and then by blustery walls
of water, the sound getting louder as we approached. She beckoned me to go
no further when we were nearly there: it seemed too intense, dangerous.
I shouted that I just wanted to see what it looked like behind, and made
my way alongside. I could see a path: it could be done. It was far from
the fairy trickles those smiling faces had selfied behind — we would get
very wet indeed — but we had come this far. We had come for this.</p>
<p>She came, looked, smiled and said I was crazy. We went for it. At one
point I turned around to check she was coming along okay and a great
rivulet of waterfall found a gap in my defenses and ran down my
bumcrack. It was marvelous. Like standing on the prow of a ship in full
storm. Roaring and soaking and blowing and grinning.</p>
<p>We came out the other side laughing and I took us on what I believed
would be the adventurer’s trail I had spoken of. A sign on the other side
of the river had already said we had reached the point of turning
back but I presumed that merely applied to the unprepared. I could see there was a kind of path heading off along the river,
picking its way along the steeps of its banks — or the sides of the
ravine as it may be. I had read that it was an old path, unsigned, and
broken or lost in places, a mere ledge in others, but that it was
navigable. I saw what I expected to see and when the path disappeared
and we found ourselves scrambling along the steeps I assumed things
would pick up — maybe just around that next bluff
we would find the old path again.</p>
<p>It was starting to get dark and the going was really tough.
Bits were far too steep and we had to slide down on our bums, or else climb up
on all fours, other times beating our way through brambles. She asked me to check
the map again. I was not looking at it much as my battery was low. I
was sure we were on the right path. I had seen well enough that this
last waterfall was coming from the opposite direction, thus knew we
would be coming to a place where the two rivers would meet — but I
hadn’t analysed the full meaning of that. I assumed one could cross
under the waterfall and work their way back along the other side, but
now I saw how stupid I had been — we would come to the point of a
triangle between two rivers and be unable to advance except by a surely
impossible crossing. We were separated from the bank we wanted to be on
by the river I had daftly assumed we had just crossed! At least I had
the good sense to listen to my wife and to check the map, then to turn us,
apologetically, straight around. We would have to brave the
waterfall one last time!</p>
<p>Only it didn’t seem so much like fun, now, with the sun going down
and the prospect of retracing what had been some very challenging steps.
I became suffused with a sense of dread. I thought about the couple who had
died and the narrative perfection of that being a premonition of our
own deaths was too great to resist. It would make the perfect end to the
story, wouldn’t it? The family splitting into two, the odd couple
taking their resentment off to the hills and giving themselves up to
the waterfalls. Or being taken. Fated sacrifices to the fairies.</p>
<p>That is part of what I have felt happening. It is as if one strand of
the fairy family has gone, been lost, or else another side has been
chosen, or chosen us. And it is the troggs, the grumpy ones, the gnomes.
They are not malicious, not evil, although they align with the dark,
with cold and mist and old trees and such. But they are not light, they
are not flower fairies. But maybe I am just feeling winter? Because we are a
flowery place, a flowery little freakhold. Still, that is what I feel.</p>
<p>I feel my own grump and cynical streak. My own meaner giggles. The loss of
one of our strands of fairy lights. The tumbling of the hawthorn. Are we
then Blackthorn, Lichen, and Stone? The dark fairy tree? The one
unredeemed by the saviour’s suffering? The one that gave angry clubs to
the Irish? The one that resists?</p>
<p>I think of her beautiful blossoms in Spring, sweeter to smell and
earlier than the Hawthorn. I love you, Blackthorn, I do.</p>
<p>We trace our way back along the mistaken path as it gets darker. It
is still a relief to see the waterfall despite the grim promise of it.
She wants me to go in front. I don’t want to. We already changed places
on the path for a few steps, with me taking the lead, but it felt
strange and disconcerting not to be able to see her. I was worried the
water spirits were going to snatch her. I think she reassured me though,
that that was what she wanted to do: she felt safer or better when following me. I would
turn one more time at the midway point to check — feeling the waterfall
in my crack — but she was there. We made it through.</p>
<p>I was displeased with myself but she was gracious. I really thought
we were goners, that the couple in the river was us, announced to
ourselves through a time-glitch as a warning I had failed to heed — and it
would've been on me, because she hadn’t even heard the story — that sarcastic echo of
my “adventurers” played through my mind: “The family said they were
thrill-seekers.”</p>
<p>I didn’t tell her all this until we were on the last stretch, the
setting sun having poked out from beneath a cloud bank, bathing us all
in the colour of warmth. I asked her if she wouldn’t have been okay with
it, even liked it in a way: not a bad way to go, into the wild waters,
to become a nature spirit guarding the valley?</p>
<p>She said she wasn’t ready.</p>
<p>I laughed, said I felt our story was a long one. “It goes a long way
forward and a long way back, and at the start and end of it there is a
single thing that links it up into a great loop, do you know what it
is?”</p>
<p>She smiled at me, saying she didn’t.</p>
<p>“This kiss,” I said, and pecked her on the lips.</p>
<p>“You’re such a poet,” she cooed, only half-joking.</p>

<hr />

<p>Well, that’s nice, the sun has come out. I feel much better when what
I have to say has some light in it, but I think it is good practise,
allowing the bitter dark. I just don’t want to moan, or become a
complainer. I know how much of a difference our approach makes. I just
don’t think that means we should thus always choose the light. I don’t
even think the light is just light, anyway, just as the dark isn’t
simply the absence of something. And colour is more than merely their
meeting.</p>
<p>I wished I could write a proper gothic nature tale where that couple
go into the water at the end, or else seem to. I wish I could do justice to
it, somehow weave in all the complications of the family situation,
doing justice to each character from their own angles — but I don’t
think I can. I want to write stories that somehow just aren’t me. Things
I think I am not capable of.</p>
<p>But then I think of Mabon Calling, how many people there were in
that. How it was a story of sorts. I am clearly capable of writing
something. I just have to get on with finding out what it is. I am not
sure it is this. This is in there, somehow, but I am not sure I want to
put it out there.</p>
<p>I don’t know.</p>
<p>Perhaps I need another cycle or two of Cuckoo Work? Is she really
simply a Great Mother, the Goddess of Spring who seems to be in the
background of that working, the Goddess of Love… does she have all that
much to do with giving birth? Is that the only way to imagine fertility?
Is all Creation some kind of Production? Can I make something and still
say nothing, change nothing, make a real difference that way? What do I
even mean by this? What of all those strange self-cancelling negatives?
What is my issue with Positivity? How can I have this kind of problem
and yet basically conceive of myself as sunny and happy? Apparently
coming across as such to others? What is the real meaning of Silly? Of
the Good Folk? Of the Goodness of God?</p>
<p>Is there really much difference between Goddess and God? Isn’t there
something misplaced about this? Isn’t it too easy to think it, or feel
it, from the wrong direction? If God creates by removing himself, is not
the absent Father himself a womb? I remain a man, but it wasn’t until I
knew myself as Goddess that I felt any closer to her. It was feeling the
woman inside me, that put a bit more vigour in my fuck, made a bit of
more sense of the golden rule… Do unto others as you would have them do
unto you. Transpose that onto fucking, or making love, if we must, and
it makes a world of sense.</p>
<p>But sensation is not enough. It is and is not sense. Meaning only
immanentises to a degree. Reject transcendence at yer peril. Fuck the
Archies, whether patri- or matri-, but don’t mistake what can never be
here, nor never not, for some kind of boss or permission to be a boss —
nor for the beginning or end of natural authority. But I don’t want to
rant. I’m not really saying this. This is what I don’t want to write. I
don’t want to tell myself how it is, anymore than I do anyone else. I
have no idea.</p>
<p>I just want to explore. I want to see the things that feel they need
to be said coming up in the course of adventure, in and as life, as
happenings, not mere statements. It is nothing but who I am and how I
feel anyhow, really. Not a sensible or logical thing to communicate to
another, not a system — not not, yes, always, and I will knot it up, and
knot it out — but it’s all gist. It’s me going with my flow and you
following your nose, and that is enough said.</p>
<p>The only other thing I thought about was trying to record some
memories of that wonderful walk we took. The day before the above — the
Wednesday then — up to Offa’s Dyke from the little carpark a wee way
back along the path from the farm. Up the pass there, Black or Red
Darren, I think he was. Over the top in that whipping wind, the rain
having thankfully let off. A good walk along the top there, and then
turning and coming down the other side towards Llanthony Priory.</p>
<p>Sat in the woods just before it, under the greatest in a line of
three wild Yews. The atmosphere was thick, for me, charged with a dark
power that was not not oppressive. It is the feeling Yew has when you
meet an old one in the wilds, outside the bounds of a church. It is a
heavy kind of liminality, a thinness between the worlds that feels a
thickening of sorts: it has gravity, a weightiness.</p>
<p>I could see she didn’t really seem to feel it, and this comforted me.
I marvelled at and appreciated it. I think she did feel it, but it was
something else for her, just as other, I imagine, but less ghostly or
spiritual — more natural somehow. Just the Yews, in other words.</p>
<p>A good place to shelter from the rain. A welcome darkness. A happy if
heavy place…</p>
<p>On the way out I examined the great one more closely and saw that a
side of it was opening up, showing a wide core of hard but dead wood
that would surely take an age to begin to weather away. I thought of the
Goddess carved in the oak at Cae Mabon. I said to her, Look at all that
lovely dead wood, you could carve a Goddess in there.</p>
<p>She smiled, There are enough human shapes around.</p>

<hr />

<p>We went down the slippy hill towards the ruins — my shoes were less
grippy than hers and at one point I was briefly skiing.</p>
<p>We walked up the road then, direction Capel-y-ffin. Took longer than
we thought to tread that five or so miles. It was past time to turn back
by the time we got there. I did a quick round of prismantics and we went
back up to Vision Farm and took the path straight up over the hill.</p>
<p>Lost it a bit coming down the other side and it took us a while to
find the zagging ridge that dealt with the steepest bit. She began to
panic a little, or at least get a little scared. She couldn’t see the
road we were aiming for, didn’t recognise the valley this far up and it
would soon be dark. I assured her we would be on the road before night
fell. There was a farm not too far away, the road would surely
go there. So long as we didn’t start climbing up the other side I didn’t
think we could go wrong. But it was true, I couldn’t see the road. Then I thought I could.</p>
<p>No, she said, it is a river.</p>
<p>No, I said, it is a road.</p>
<p>We aimed for it: a long puddle. There was
little satisfaction in our both being wrong, however, because it gave the uncanny sense of our having shared a hallucination: it was like coming
across a mirage — I had thought it a road until almost the last minute.
We were stuck in the corner of a field now, surrounded by barbed
wire.</p>
<p>But I could still see the farm.</p>
<p>Don’t worry Chou, we’ll head for the farm, we’ll find the road from
there without doubt. If not we can ask for help.</p>
<p>We found the road, followed it home as darkness fell.</p>
<p>A good walk!</p>

<hr />

<p>And then we came back via Glastonbury. I had been left disappointed
by our first visit on the way there — we got stuck in that expensive honey trap of a
centre and only managed a drive-by of the well. I really wanted to visit the
Chalice Well.</p>
<p>So this time we parked on a side street and went to visit it.
It was lovely, very peaceful. I saw Jesus, or The Great Druid, or
a version of myself, in the Lion’s Head that the water gushes out of. Took a photo of them. It was
actually quite startling. The sun came out and the whole scene was
glistening. I was watching the screen of my camera like a revelation: I
was seeing what I did not expect to and it brightened the world with
its light. More than light, really, is clarity. It is somehow more than
light, what shines — the emptiness itself — what we sometimes call
darkness, other times love? The light itself is perfect raging. It is
the darkness that is love. We can make some gains understanding these
not-things as Goddess and God, or attributes of such, and we can lose
something too. Just the same as if we view them only scientifically.</p>
<p>Winter seems so much more than a distant sun, and the coming of
spring not simply a lightening. Reductions from wholeness all, from the
plenum, the pleroma, that fullness that is our total obliteration… and
yet somehow none of this is cancelled. It all balances out to a joyous
non-event, more real and more happening than anything that is really
happening can be. And this somehow makes all life, all existence… every
heart a sanctuary.</p>
