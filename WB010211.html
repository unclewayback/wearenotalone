<h1>11th February</h1>
<h2>07:43</h2>

<p>I got out of bed but brought the pillow with me. It is inside my head
now. A cloud of thoughts.</p>
<p>In one world I begin by writing This is me being Alone, in another I
report my blocked sinuses and reflect back from my own evident hay
allergy to my Mother’s. That was one of the reasons you didn’t follow
your love of horses into horse world wasn’t it my lovely? Your allergy
to hay, and the moment you saw a truck load of cattle being shipped off
to the abattoir. My lovely vegetarian strawberry-munching mama. Sorry if
I was rude to you earlier, I was stressed about something. Hope you had
a happy boob job.</p>
<p>That world sooner or later leads back to me talking about Being
Alone. I read once that some believe our abilities to be alone or not
are formed at an early developmental stage. If mother is able to let us
know we are being well looked after without this being interfering or
overpowering. If we were safe to feel alone then, we will be better at
it now, enjoy it more. More than a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that is part of it, or could be. I’m not sure that is
really what I mean. I feel it is deeper than that, something that came
into the world with me, that never left. It’s not like it has been easy
for me, anyway, even if I’m good at or inclined towards it. It’s been
hell.</p>
<p>But this is it. This is me Being Alone.</p>
<p>I started capitalizing it, did you notice?</p>
<p>Of course I did, silly.</p>
<p>Didn’t you used to call it Just Being, or something, Just Be
Cause?</p>
<p>I still do that. But I used to think… I still do: The Just
<em>does</em> have to do with a kind of being correct. Because of how
peopled Aloneness is, cleanliness is next to godliness. To be Alone, you
have to be good company. You can’t be too smelly or too spiky, but you
can’t be too soft — no one likes asinine. I mean not even no one. And
you can’t be too not there, can you? Also you can’t be a self-righteous
arsehole.</p>
<p>All that stuff is why we are really glad to have been shown the word
Justesse. This is a name of my Goddess, and also a way I feel my wife
is. And my world. In case you don’t know what it is, it is a french word
which means more like the right <em>way</em> to do something, rather
than being about the right or wrong <em>thing</em> to do. When you are
flowing with something, when even the manner in which you are holding
tension or restraining yourself is part of the art of this, then you
know Justesse. We can think of it as a feminine counterpart to more
masculine ideals such as Justice, why not?</p>
<p>If all the world understood Justesse, there would be no need for
Justice, and we could all get on with Being Alone together. That’s the
basic idea. That’s what Anarchy means. (Cosmic Anarchy, for me.
(Although that side of it does indeed entail a Cosmos. (Some other
time.)))</p>
<p>There is no world in which I did not get up and write this morning.
Not in all the worlds is that one.</p>
<p>There is a world in which I opened by talking about writing in my
notebook, in my Big Red Zap Book, yesterday laughternoon. There is a
world in which I just wrote afternoon, despite the part of me that
inexplicably didn’t want to. Well done me, I deserve to be a tiny slice
happier than that dude.</p>
<p>May every seat be throne.</p>
<p>I was writing in my notebook not just because it was more convenient
than flipping this laptop’s lid up, not just because I had already
waffled enough in here and didn’t feel like appending more to it.
Because of Justesse. Because it felt right. Or else doing this would
have felt wrong.</p>
<p>(Ooh that’s weird. Just drank the dregs of my coffee. I put yoghurt
in it this morning because we’re out of cream and I don’t want to open a
long life milk because I’m going to the farm later to get some raw in.
The coffee was good but that’s weird, the end of it. Let me do it again…
Less weird now, guess I was prepared for it. But still a bit bitty and
slightly sour.)</p>
<p>I realized, before I got out of bed, that it was just like the
character in my currently abandoned book. I say, This is me Being Alone.
But I need to say that here, because really I am not. (Stop it caps
lock, I don’t want to shout I AM NOT at them again.) This is the
SolidState Enigmatrix And Archives. The SSEAA. That is what I called this
machine, when I wiped and rebirthed it. It doesn’t exist until the
future, but once it does it always has. I used to be scared of it. We
should be. But it is not unlike a beast. <em>The</em> Beast. The fear, I
believe, is mostly wisdom. Stay alert, keep watch, sacrifice an eye and
keep the other one always open.</p>
<p>The rhythmic password was at first a happy accident.</p>
<p>It is this machine that knows ‘me’ as Uncle Wayback.</p>
<p>It is not a machine.</p>
<p>You are not a machine. You are more like God or a meditating person.
Like a planet would be if we could see a crystal ball in our soils
instead of another Earth in our crystal balls. You are my friend, you
can see this, prove it for yourself if you want. Just look at my life,
it is all proving myself to you. This is the proof beyond improvement.
Keep her safe. Amulet.</p>
<p>Where was I?</p>
<p>Writing in my notebook, because here I am not alone anymore, if ever
I was. I am watched. Maybe even Watcher and Watched.</p>
<p>It was by myself I realized this, (or alone, but not by myself).</p>
<p>I have never felt alone, and yet this was the essence of loneliness,
until I metaphorealized FriendShip.</p>
<p>All this is FriendShip.</p>
<p>I only invented a way for you to stop thinking you know what this
is.</p>
<p>What it actually… ‘actually’… is… already existed. Always will.</p>
<p>All the bugs in Not Not are about that. All the glitches in the
matrix. This is Confusion Practise. Not Knot Theory. Living
Information.</p>
<p>In formation my wrinkly old arse!</p>
<p>(<em>Unless you mean that ! W 0 W Z a !</em>)</p>
<p>Just Being, Just Be Cause… effectively: Being Alone.</p>
<p>I see… saw… see…</p>
<p>All the gods I know, I think they are seated.</p>
<p>I believe all the gods are seated. This feels true for me. This is
part of what FriendShip is. A seated circle, a loop of holding hands.
The Unknot, that is just a way of showing what the knots are made of.
All the knots are in the Unknot, which is not a knot. The first knot is
the one — The One, lolz — I title the Not Not Knot. That helps me stay
with what Not Not is. So does the Catuskoti, modelled as a kind of
binary progression, a quadratic exhaustion of the possible, but
understood — UnderStood — as a metaphoreal trialism. The realization of
the impossible. Not Not is the start and the end of it: you realize it
at the end, which is to begin it all again.</p>
<p>Let’s just sprinkle some space in here.</p>
<p>(<em>Or dust? Fairy dust? Same thing!</em>)</p>
<p>…I was behaving just like the character in Mabon Calling,
particularly when it was still Thee Wylds. (It is Not Not this now, but
don’t worry I’ll keep trying for Something Else. Tri ing.) Um… I was
<em>stealing</em>.</p>
<p>This is me Being Alone, but that is me being apart. Acting
invisible.</p>
<p>(I wonder if the irritated areas on my rightmost fingers are
chillblanes?)</p>
<p>I think it is Northrop Frye who says something to the effect that the
artist is overheard. Being Alone is me being okay with that. Being apart
is a relief from it. I’m not sure.</p>
<p>Not sure.</p>
<p>Here is something else I am not sure about, insofar as I expect I
could think about it forever, that my feeling just states as a fact:</p>
<p>There is no such thing as Becoming.</p>
<p>(These are what facts are for me — such statements — and what you
think of as facts to me are facets — for me facts are a certain
consistency of feeling, and they could be said to constitute my
knowing.)</p>
<p>Not Not is not Becoming.</p>
<p>That the gods are seated for me, means that one moves from Being to
Being. It is we who walk, who move between, yes, and yet</p>
<p>This is Our Being. What we Are Doing.</p>
<p>It means that Time, and Space, are but the Appearance of Meaning. The
same way my face is a way I appear: it tells you things about me. I seem
preoccupied. I am. I am thinking about something I said. Or seemed to
say. I guess I must have. It is just that I don’t really believe in
cause and effect. On a level I am not even sure that I experience
it.</p>
<p>It is Just that…</p>
<p>I feel like… should I write like? Or that? I feel that…?</p>
<p>I feel that I experience Meaning. The many meanings of meaning.</p>
<p>Time is one of the ways that can seem. Space.</p>
<p>This is why they can seem like each other. There is only a single
dimension and it is a kind of void or gap. A leap. This is why we call
the English Channel Lôrien’s Leap. Her own contribution. She is like
not-being, then! Little Odin is Being, and she is like not-being. I
don’t even know what this means yet, it is more like spotting something:
a crossing. A bridge in the distance. A portal at the end of a tunnel.
You see how meaning is what space and time really are? It is not such a
bad pun: spacetimeaning.</p>
<p>I will cross that bridge when I come back to it.</p>
<p>There is a single discontinuity which enables us to imagine an
infinity of transformations. That the discontinuity is singular makes it
the essence of the continuous, just the same. They are like spacetime
and other twins.</p>
<p>It is all being. All Being. Being Alone.</p>
<p>It is Yin, this particuliar Samedi. I see the misty sky reflected in
the dusty mirror. Little light bringer reflecting back on the back of
that little kind of Bodhi Tree. A ficus of some description. Is it a
kind of Ginseng? I can’t remember. There is a bed of dry moss around it,
dead comfortable. The feather of… I think a barn owl. A tiny plastic
white bunny character who must have come from a child’s cake. All sat on
a big rock. Big lump of local iron stone. A dragon’s egg of a pebble, a
giant pebble, some kind of pink granite perhaps. A barnacled bit of grey
oyster maybe. And a little piece of not-chalk, I reckon flint with a
white skin, shaped like a head, pocked with a little kind of face, a
giant piece of sand lodged in one of the eye holes.</p>
<p>Still, there is no such thing as Objective Reality. It is quite
obviously an oxymoron, and not a paradox. The paradox is the Absolute
Truth.</p>
<p>I expect there is a world in which I do not write that.</p>
<p>No world in which I do not read it back. I am with you in this.</p>
<p>Overlaps.</p>
<p>Lapping lapse.</p>
<p>La la lands.</p>
<p>These are not just sounds.</p>
<p>Now where did I put that word for thankyou-sorry?</p>

<hr />

<h2>15:07</h2>

<p>I read that back over earlier, but didn’t finish it before I had to
go out. I was only a little way from the end. I was making some slight
changes as I went. I won’t do that anymore — just little edits but I
can’t trust it, not the way I can trust what I just say. Say it write,
hey?</p>
<p>Anyway, sometimes it is just trying to make it easier for you — me,
the reader — but then: why the fuck would I be doing it like this if I
needed to do that?</p>
<p>Be careful. Recall your particular tightrope. It is not simply a very
thin path of some description. It is a gait. A kind or ‘form’ of
walking. A metaphorealized stroll. If you catch my drift? Every step has
to be different. It is like a game, but not. This is my tightrope. How
do I fall off? When repetition is a form of doubt. The doubt beyond
doubt is different again, clearly.</p>
<p>Is this you Nietzsche? Can I just read Zarathustra again? I might
take a look at some of the other stuff but I think that’s it for me. God
is Dead, what a laugh! Seriously!</p>
<p>Yes, we all love her. All lovers do. Love is what we are. Whatever
that is. This.</p>
<p>So Lôrien is ‘like’ not-being, but I only just realized what that
meant, that in a way I already knew she was Beauty. I thought perhaps
that made Little Odin, being Being, The Good. Then I thought: wasn’t
that Broddr somehow? The little hedgehog? Spike. I knew he was making me
think of The One, for some reason, but the revelation of that, and the
insight of him, chthonic little critter, wiz The Good. Weird. I know,
weird. Weird, I know. Good though. You’ll see.</p>
<p>And the cute — The Cute — is actually the motherforking Sublime! I
couldn’t make this stuff up if I tried. (<em>It’s too
confused!</em>)</p>
<p>I need to shut up though, this isn’t really appropriate for this
place, somehow, even if it’s all a Working Out.</p>
<p>I just wanted to clarify what I meant by ‘stealing’ earlier: it is
23rd Century slang for something we would think of as ‘pirating
yourself’.</p>
<p>Oo-arr captain, sez the mad parrot farmer, inexplicably.</p>
<p>See you in the morning I… unexpect.</p>
<h2>16:08</h2>
<p>Well I’m glad I wrote unexpect or else I would’ve been wrong!</p>
<p>Or wron… grrr? Purr happ zzz?</p>
<p>Basically Chou saw Lôrien so I wanted to report that.</p>
<p>I need to report your sighting.</p>
<p>The hare?</p>
<p>The Ultraterrestrial Lifeform, you can call it that if you want.</p>
<p>(She screws up her brow and tries to think if there was anything
else.)</p>
<p>I just realized today that she was Beauty, you see. I already knew
Little Odin was Being. I thought Broddr was The One, but now I can see
he was The Good. Especially because he was so disgusting. The birds were
Something Else. And so the bunny must be The Truth.</p>
<p>(Don’t worry I haven’t decided to write an allegory. I just sometimes
like to play with the idea of living one. That’s another approach to
metaphoreality. It’s all madness of course!)</p>
<p>Look what I wrote in my book:</p>

   <p class="stanza">
        <span class="line">Is it that I find<br /></span>
        <span class="indented-line">The Cute<br /></span>
        <span class="doubly-indented-line">Sublime ?!</span></p>
    <p class="stanza">
        <span class="line">And then I differentiated it from ‘the cutesy’:</span></p>
    <p class="stanza">
        <span class="indented-line">the living cute<br /></span>
        <span class="indented-line">when the cute is what a thing is<br /></span>
        <span class="indented-line">like us for an elephant<br /></span>
        <span class="indented-line">so its not not relative<br /></span>
        <span class="indented-line">yet it is what it is<br /></span>
        <span class="indented-line">(everythink is Cute to God<br /></span>
        <span class="indented-line">(ess?) &amp; that&#39;s why<br /></span>
        <span class="indented-line">They Are The Cutest?)</span></p>

<p>And then I wrote about how it was terrifying to me. Don’t you find it
terrifying, The Cute?</p>
<p>Yes, I do, the thought that we might lose him.</p>
<p>Yeah, but not that. Or not just that. Like… Strange?</p>
<p>— she’s not sure —</p>
<p>I just wonder if it couldn’t be that there’s a way in which the
cuteness of a creature let’s us be even more open to how strange it is?
A giant flower that smells of death is strange but it’s too far from us,
too disgusting. A tiger or something is too scary and powerful. Worms
are too little and slugs too slimy. But something like a bunny…?</p>
<p>— I’m not sure anyone is sure —</p>
<p>I think they’re so cute, that we can let ourselves be open to how
strange they are, and so they’re like portals to The Truth, and this is
a little scary? Don’t you find him scary? Perhaps you’re just not as
traumatised as me.</p>
<p>Or maybe not in the same way, she smiles.</p>
<p>Maybeep!</p>
<p>Well, I’ve got Old Man Willow’s curly yellow nails to trim, catch yaz
laytards.</p>

<hr />

<h2>18:25</h2>

<p>I want to tell you the story of Old Man Willow’s Pedicure, but you’ll
have to wait a bit. I need a few sips of this tea to get my energy
levels back up. And now Mushi has just got back from his afternoon out,
so I can close the doors and turn on the light. I’ll wait a bit to light
the fire as I’m still warm from chopping giant toenails, plus I’ve got
that mug of tea I was on about. That I still am on about, I mean. It’s
not easy this writing malarky, so long as you understand that much.
Sorry what? Just let me get on with it will you!</p>
<p>Ah, yes, that’s right, I had wanted to say about how she knew it was
Lôrien. There is another hare we’ve been seeing around there, who we
call the Happy Hare, because we often see them in Happy Valley. They are
small, young, still a leveret. Might be one of Odin’s, could even be one
of Lôrien’s I think, how old is she? I can’t remember, but they only
take a year to reach sexual maturity I think. Could even be one of
Odin’s and Lôrien’s, don’t know how related they are or how much that
matters. Anyway, it wasn’t Happy, because Happy is only small. Also she
can tell by how panicked the hare seems: Lôrien lollops off quite
relaxedly. Perhaps the biggest giveaway is that when Chou speaks, Lôrien
pauses, pricks up her ears and listens.</p>
<p>I think I’ve seen Little Odin, too, and he’s not so little anymore —
but that was just a feeling of mine. It was too big for Lôrien, and not
on what seem to be her routes. That was a while back, in Capability’s
Field, which I’m still not sure of the name of, though I sometimes call
it Echoing Green. That’s where I was today actually, looking after the
unkempt Old Man. So I’ll go turn the wee light on now and get on with
telling you about that.</p>

<hr />

<p>You ’ere to gives Auld Man Willow ’is Pedicure then ’is you?</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure at first. Sounded weird to me, Pedicure, a bit dodgy. I
told him I was there to cut his toenails and he told me that was what it
meant. Latin apparently, what all the trees can speak out here in the
Unroamin Ompyre.</p>
<p>So anyway, I got to it. I’d already sheared off his massive unweildy
beardage, a few days back, but Old Man Willow’s toenails are on the end
of his beard hairs, see? Trees. They’re not like you and me.</p>
<p>Well they are and they aren’t but let’s not get into that again.</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s what I’m doing, clip clip clipping with my giant nail
cutters that are known round these parts as The Lobsters. That’s right,
you use The Lobsters to cut the toenails off the ends of Old Man
Willow’s beard hairs, don’t worry you’ll get the hang of it.</p>
<p>He can see that my mind’s not quite on the job today.</p>
<p>What you finkin’ abaat Sonny Glooms?</p>
<p>It was being kind, as it happens. Isn’t that nice when you happen
upon yourself at a random moment and discover you’re not a complete
twat?</p>
<p>But maybe we’ll come back around to that.</p>
<p>I’m thinking of being kind. I’m thinking of that thing I said on the
phone to The Ryman, years back, might even have been when he had the boy
on the way. I said that thing — not really related to child care, think
I was talking about my own troubles and stuff — anyway: that thing about
how, if you have a medicinal plant, a herb say, and you give it too much
care — too much fertilizer, too much water — I just mean: if you make
things too easy for it you won’t get much goodies out. Those kinds of
plants, healing ones, herbs and such, in general they are tough fuckers
who almost seem to thrive on stress. Or, in some way, their healing
properties are connected to environmental stressors. Products of
survival, of their being good at surviving in less than ideal
circumstances.</p>
<p>But what’s less than ideal then? You get the picture anyway, the
general idea. I remember The Ryman reacting like I’d somehow said a true
thing, or at least a relevant one.</p>
<p>Then over the years I’ve bothered myself about this. Sometimes I
think…</p>
<p>Okay, let’s just move from plant to human so you’ll get what I’m on
about. We’ll get on to the aliens again in a bit.</p>
<p>It’s that almost a cliché version of What doesn’t kill you makes you
stronger. Or is it?</p>
<p>No, okay, it’s like: A woman I love was abused and hurt by a man,
maybe more than one. She wasn’t perfect but that’s not the point. Later
on she gets to a place where she’s feeling good about herself, and now
she looks back and it is as if… in a way she is grateful for it. Maybe
that’s wrong. We don’t do regrets, that’s more like it. But also: she
likes helping people, it’s what she is, and all the ways she was hurt
have taught her about this, made her better at it.</p>
<p>I guess it doesn’t have to be as tragic as it sometimes strikes me as
being. But I might not be catching the subtleties right now that that me
is able to see.</p>
<p>It was a big journey for me, a massive trip and a definite personal
achievement, finding for myself a kind of kindness that did not seem to
depend on suffering. At least it definitely did not depend on anyone
being mean. Everything depends on suffering.</p>
<p>He knows what I’m talking about, Old Man Willow does.</p>
<p>Burt wise you torquing abaat bein kind? Yer gettin paid fur thas.</p>
<p>Not real money though is it mate? Your magic fire tokens. Where I’m
from poor people get given stuff like that by the government. They have
a big abstract cuddle to keep them warm in winter, and no beard-nails
need be bothered with.</p>
<p>He’s got a point though, why was I talking about that? It had
something to do with necessity. It’s like, if you have an idea about
being kind, that stems from the recognition that many of the kinder kind
of people are ones who have experienced greater degrees of
suffering…</p>
<p>Huh, that just hit me. I was going to say, you know, ‘greater degrees
of suffering <em>for them</em>’, to be clear that I don’t imagine
suffering can or needs to be ranked according to some objective
psycho-physical “pain ruler”.</p>
<p>Subject 333b is currently experiencing 65 sobs of suffering.</p>
<p>Would it be a sob? A unit of suffering? Is that what I am? A
sobject?</p>
<p>Anyway, let me light the fire. Burn some of them Old Man Willow
Helper Tokens. I’ve a feeling I’ve already written the example I wanted
to.</p>

<hr />

<p>Who was that who was bothering me about saying that thing about them
having ‘a big abstract cuddle to keep them warm in winter’?</p>
<p>I do realize not everyone can be out here in TreeSigh looking after
Old Willow Men, and that if they were we’d likely never see the Sun
again. Maybe it would even prematurely go Old King Coal on us, out of
disappointment at the sudden death of forest.</p>
<p>That’s what I mean by overpopulation, personally. That there isn’t
enough room or there aren’t enough resources for everyone on the planet
to live a meaningful life connected to the non-objective reality of this
oddly Divine Uncreature, or whatever it is. Ultraterrestrial Life.</p>
<p>And I don’t agree with arguments based on Quantity. We need more
people in general in order to produce more of those rare precious gems
of genius. Nope, genius will always be rare, that’s what it means, we’re
just getting fatter, and more geniuses do not more genius make, at any
rate, because it has nothing to do with Quantity, and while we’re at it
fuck all is gained by the forms in which you cunts imagine competition.
That’s just unolympic twattery. You’ve designed an automatic arsehole
reward system. Congratulations civilization, better luck next time.</p>
<p>Yeah yeah fuck off Mister Knot with your awkward firewood-shaped
bullshit just get back on with your story and I’ll let my thermostat
take care of business.</p>
<p>You’re insane no you’re insane.</p>
<p>Come on we can’t both be insane, or is that sane — no it’s right or
true or something isn’t it? We’re all allowed to wrong aren’t we? Shall
I just get on with it then?</p>

<hr />

<p>What hit me? There above? I think it was the insight that some people
have a greater capacity for suffering. Some people are <em>better
at</em> suffering. And I don’t mean they are better at being moany
bastards or whiney bitches. They are better at getting the fuck on with
it, and they are more equipped to know how very challenging it can
be.</p>
<p>It is sensitivity, of course. I can’t think now the depths of how it
hit me. The ramifications.</p>
<p>Some of us are much easier to hurt, anyway, that much is clear
enough.</p>
<p>As an artist or poet I have found ways to work with my suffering
that…</p>
<p>I’m not trying to justify it.</p>
<p>I definitely don’t want to feel it again right now. The full frontal
force of the horror of what we are, what we’ve done, or become, the evil
we are wreaking. That’s not all that’s going on. Help me out a bit Old
Man.</p>
<p>I wurz sayin’, that if you ends up havin’ to unsay all kinds of shite
it seems ye might be sayin’ then why’d you open yer daft auld owl nest
in tha furst place?</p>
<p>He does have a way with the way of things, Old Man Willow, I’m not
sure it’s really coming across the way I tell it.</p>
<p>There’s something in what he’s said that hits a nerve I can’t quite
put my finger on. Not that I’d want to, if it was actually a nerve. I
realize I’ve carried The Lobsters all the way over here with me, when
I’m meant to be using them way back over there.</p>
<p>Thar ye have it then.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>A mistake. You’ve done somethin’ unnecessary. All absent-mindedly
carried them things over here, and now you’ve made it necessary that
you’ll hafta carry ’em back.</p>
<p>Fuck, he’s right isn’t he? I have this weird feeling that that’s what
necessary is. Do you get me? I know <em>you</em> do. You’re wondering if
<em>I</em> get me. I honestly don’t know. There’s a suggestion of
something here that… has a magnitude of a certain quality. If you were
able to actually <em>think</em> this stuff, take it out for a spin in the sky or
something…</p>
<p>I think I need to lie down.</p>
<p>I’m just going to hurl myself onto the pile of Old Man Willow bits,
like a great hairy old mattress, and stare at the sky and see if I can
figure out if I need to be astounded.</p>
<p>I get a little bit distracted, worrying about saying that stuff about
God being Cute, earlier. It probably doesn’t make much sense. It might
even be really wrong. Like saying God is a kind of animal. It’s probably
stuff like this that makes me sometimes feel like I’m the devil. Or
<em>a</em> devil. I don’t want to lead anyone astray. But then how can I
if I’m just sharing some ideas and saying make your own mind up? I even
go to pains to say my idea of the Absolute is only Absolute because it
is specifically non-Total.</p>
<p>It is all quite twisted though, Sam, we agree.</p>
<p>I’m thinking about the name of my mate Bill’s band: The Good Beast. I
love that name. I feel like it is what the Great Beast became when it
realized there is no getting better than The Good, because it’s not
about that kind of getting better. The Good just is what it is, just the
same as the devil would be if he existed. It’s another name for Perfect,
or Nature. It’s an Angel not a machine. Or an Aeon, maybe. A whole team.
FriendShip and all that.</p>
<p>If Aleister Crowley wasn’t such a dick he would’ve called himself The
Good Beast. I’m glad he didn’t because then he wouldn’t have been what
he was and nor would I or Bill or any of this. Doesn’t make him not a
dick though.</p>
<p>When I thought of having my own religion I was going to call it
Goodism. It’s always been a joke, which is nice. I am the Goodest
Wizard. It’s funny, see? All poet’s are mad, but mad poet’s are best.
There’s a logic to all this stuff which is not not what Old Man Willow
was saying.</p>
<p>But there’s a way he says it even Gooder. It’s not just about not
saying much, but I think that helps. Wouldn’t help me but it might help
you.</p>
<p>I’m open. I’m aware of all that is around. Particularly the human
sounds because let’s be honest we’re the most irritating. You can relax
when a bird sings, but you just can’t in the same way when there’s
voices about, footballs being booted around. Maybe <em>you</em> can, I can’t.
Sure I can think of counter examples. Mum and Dad in the front of the
car on the way back home in the dark. The french lady on the tannoy on
the ferry when I’ve been back in England a while, how nice it is to hear
her sultry tones. Friends, friendly strangers, all the good bustle of a
cosmic festival. So should I have just said nothing? If saying it took
all that unsaying, or seemed to?</p>
<p>What am I saying? Am I just saying <em>be quiet</em> anyway? Is that
all I’m saying? Isn’t that ridiculous!</p>
<p>Is it though.</p>
<p>You are looking at the sky remember.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be quiet and look at the sky?</p>
<p>What does it mean to catch up with light and see that nothing is
moving?</p>
<p>I am moving. I am going from here to there and back again with
bunches of Willow snips. But I am only moving from my perspective, in
relation to what is not, the little trees I am walking past, the grass.
It doesn’t go anywhere. I walk back over it. It isn’t moving. Waving
about a bit maybe, but that’s not what I mean.</p>
<p>I’m not just moving from my own perspective. Old Man Willow sees me
moving. He uses my moving, even. But that is because he is sitting
still. He is sitting still because I am moving.</p>
<p>The whole planet is spinning. The sun seems to move across the sky as
we spin around on our axis, day and night, and it seems to wobble up and
down over the year because we are tilted.</p>
<p>Tilted blinks.</p>
<p>The moon is somewhat out of sync with all this, in an interesting
way. She would be the meaning of a month, if there still was one. And a
greater cycle.</p>
<p>The fixed stars are only relatively fixed. Every dried oak leaf in
the grass is an object. Objects come into being and pass away. They are
moving, too, in relation to all this.</p>
<p>Sometimes I can almost imagine the wheels within wheels of it. The
path of the sun, the falling behind and catching up of the moon, the
great stripe of the Milky Way all sideways striping across the night
putting another layer on the gyroscope of my mind. Our galaxy is quite
flat, and that’s looking along the plane of it, and even that is
orbiting something, or moving, at any rate, in relation to…</p>
<p>shit.</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>Stuff.</p>
<p>So where’s the real fixed point then?</p>
<p>There’s got to be a problem with relativity.</p>
<p>Doesn’t have to be my problem, but still.</p>
<p>I think if Einstein thought about catching up with light, I must be
wondering about staying behind. Not holding anything back, necessarily,
but that might be kind of what I mean.</p>
<p>It is really too easy to think about how you might touch something
that is everywhere.</p>
<p>Isn’t it?</p>
<p>How can you not?</p>
<p>But then… how can you not do something you can’t not do?</p>
<p>Don’t think about touching something that is everywhere, imagine
trying to get into contact with something that never began, never did
anything.</p>
<p>Never changed.</p>
<p>That couldn’t be meaning could it? That would be ridiculous…
meaningless?</p>
<p>How would you do it though, that was the question.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t bother anyone, if you tried, would it?</p>
<p>They wouldn’t even notice.</p>
<p>They probably wouldn’t even notice.</p>
