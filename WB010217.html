<h1>18th February</h1>
<h2>07:40</h2>

<p>Spent some time yesterday fiddling with those knots, the lovely
sevens. It is hard to explain the particuliar way in which it makes
sense to me, but the feeling is of a kind of discovery, and yet at the
same time I know I am…</p>
<p>I don’t actually. I was going to say: I know I am seeing something
that I am <em>reading into</em> the knots. The basic hyperthesis seems
to be that, just as the I-ching and the Kaballah are based to some
degree on such high or fundamental spiritual concepts that they
therefore possess mathematicisable elements, so the knots partake of,
and even show another side to or aspect of, this more or less
metaphysical reality or truth that is Being or Creation.</p>
<p>The manifestation of God, in the case of the Kaballah, in ten stages
arranged along three columns — male, female, neutral, more or less —
with twenty two paths connecting them. Thirty two, subdivided in all
manner of ways.</p>
<p>The way of the world, andor the way beyond the world, in the case of
the I-ching, unfolding within unity according to two fundamental
principles. The eight trigrams combining into the sixty four hexagrams
which form the book of changes.</p>
<p>I’m just looking at those first thirty-six knots, one of whom — The
Fool — is the Unknot, and three of whom — the last three knots of the
set of knots with eight crossings — are the first non-alternating knots.
Non-alternation will go on, more or less exponentially, to swamp the
consistent ‘over/under’ or ‘under/over’ rhythm of these early, simple,
knots. This nice orderly way of doing things will shrink to a drop or
two in an ocean of chaos. It will become largely insignificant,
mathematically. Next to nothing. Yet it won’t go anywhere. In every set
of knots with an odd-number of crossings you will still find that one
simple torus knot of which the triskle and the pentagram are both
examples.</p>
<p>You’ll always be able to find yer Wayback.</p>
<p>Who is to say what the correct way to think significance is, anyway?
Perhaps those drops in the ocean become more rather than less
significant as the idea wanders off into infinity? Aren’t they a kind of
infinite? In their ever-presence or remaining? (Even the book of changes
might not be all about changes?) Are they icons of qualitative infinity,
which then seems to associate itself with the unchanging, and suggests
an apparent finity which in truth is fathomless? And the other kind of
infinity, the endless growth and expansion, the continual stepwise
permutation… maybe that’s the one that really has its limits?</p>
<p>How I feel about the knots at the moment is that they — or a kind of
principle they can be thought to exemplify — are even more fundamental,
even closer to the source, the life-and-death-springs of meaning, than
the binary progression of the I-ching and the somewhat tripartite
alchemy of the kaballah.</p>
<p>Ahablaha!</p>
<p>Yes, it’s all silly stuff really.</p>
<p>One of my hopes, or back-up values, for this crazy project, is that
it might help people — particularly young people — who have this kind of
creative and freely associative mind, as well as a hunger for the
non-arbitrary but unfixable meanings or senses of story… to also enjoy
and begin to appreciate some of the more mathematical or analytical ways
of seeing and modes of thought. I think it might be sexier than
geometry? And anyway I think they mostly wheel Euclid out now as some
kind of fossil?</p>
<p>I like him, and I like that stuff — I have worked through some of my
issues with Geometer Gods — that’s part of what is in the knots, for
me.</p>
<p>The knots are trickster magick. They are the signs of a trickster
god. Not not loki. But I’m jumping ahead.</p>
<p>I always struggled with maths. The worst part of it was its apparent
arbitrariness. Sure, it all becomes necessary, once certain rules or
assumptions are held or accepted, provisionally or whatever. No teacher
was ever able to communicate the sense or value of this, to me. No one
ever brought it to life. No one ever gave me the <em>why</em>. Quite apart from any lack of or differing ability on my part, I feel:
I just couldn’t connect with it.</p>
<p>I had one maths teacher I liked. Mister Hallam. Little solid grumpy
guy. Big fan of Pink Floyd. The best thing about him was how you were
able, if you asked the right kind of question, to get him to forget the
plan of the lesson and just start ranting and telling stories. He loved
to talk about the Floyd, but I also remember him going on and on about
being able to turn a tennis ball inside out without making a hole in the
surface. What a magical idea. I can still see him there with his sleeves
rolled up and a tennis ball in his hands, trying to communicate to us
that it honestly would be possible if only he could twist it in a
certain way.</p>
<p>I drift further back, to one of my earliest classes. I can only have
been six or seven years old, I suppose. They were teaching us to tell
the time. It just made no sense to me. I could see the rules they wanted
me to follow, I just didn’t know <em>why</em>. Why not twenty-six hours in a day?
And we could call them A-Z instead of numbering them?</p>
<p>That a cat is called a cat makes far more sense than that. I don’t
know why or how but it does. It doesn’t really need a why, because there
is so much obviousness in miaow. It’s all fine, don’t worry about
it.</p>
<p>But those guys, the time tellers, the clock men, they should be
worried. They should ask <em>why</em> more, or at least try to play
around with inventing some answers.</p>
<p>Years later, playing around with circles, those numbers: 12, 24, 60,
360 — they all started to make sense to me, I could see where they’d
come from. But not back then. I honestly think if they’d have given that
kid a compass and shown him the flower of life he would’ve basically got
it. It would have counted as a why for him.</p>
<p>So, it’s quite possible that while the separation of numerology from
arithmetic and astrology from astronomy is necessary for science and
constitutes progress in one sense, in another sense it could be
disastrous for people like us, or minds like ours… and that might not
just be our loss in the long run.</p>
<p>So that is part of how I keep myself at this, in those times when it
seems stupid rather than silly, or merely absurd or simply ridiculous.
<em>Part</em> of it.</p>
<p>And I don’t really mean numerology and astrology, necessarily — it
depends how you see or understand those things, or not. I just mean
meaning, but obviously I need to say or show what I mean by that, and
that is probably the real heart of Not Knot Theory.</p>
<p>A word on the kind of God or gods I see in it, then, and then a word
on disappointment.</p>
<p>The knots, sometimes they are peaceful and balanced, but not often.
These kinds of knots, that could be projected cleanly and symmetrically,
or else have some pleasing relatively free flow of energy in them, some
more or less classically beautiful dynamism — they are all over the
place to begin with, and become fewer and fewer and farrer between.</p>
<p>I look at them — the bulk of the knots — and I can see something
struggling, something being tied up or bound down.</p>
<p>A strange mirror of my own attempt to express myself. Yes.</p>
<p>The secrets of creation? Why not?</p>
<p>Let those who have the minds to nevermind nevermind.</p>
<p>You can see geometry, too. It looks like we are just using it for
convenience or out of habit sometimes to assist with making neat
projections of the knots. It looks like it is behind the knots, or some
of them — as if they are arranged on top of some fundamental geometric
structure.</p>
<p>They’re not.</p>
<p>If anything, they are or can give rise <em>to</em> that. It is because of
something like them, that you — we — can craft a bunch of more or less
consistent geometric axioms. It is a potential they, and some of them in
particular, have. Give.</p>
<p>A while back, when I was thinking about Loki quite a lot, I started
thinking about something like, “Using Geometry To Explore Problems With
Authority,” something like that. The wonderful gift that smarter kids
used to be given, and perhaps still are: discovering a why in some clear
and consistent mathematical fashion. The very reason for all that
apparently arbitrary axiomaticity. All of a sudden you’re not just
randomly following a set of conventional rules that people use merely to
arrive at the right place at the same time in a boring but effective
fashion (honeybees manage to do (something like) it by waggle-dancing, y
know?) … no: now you are proving something to and for yourself, seeing
the eternal value of a series of more or less logical if-thens. You are
not being programmed, unwillingly and without comprehension, you are
being given the program, you are becoming a programmer.</p>
<p>The trickster god is God, only sometimes somehow he gets split into
different parts and one part ends up trying to tie down or contain or
pummel into submission the other. It’s all a misunderstanding, really.
An unfortunate mistake. Some kind of forgetting.</p>
<p>Not Knot Theory only wants to be some kind of a reminder. It doesn’t
want to tell you what to think, only to think. But not simply like a
programmer. Like a fucking wizard. Like a mystic, like an artist or a
poet, like something that is so alive it is almost insane.</p>
<p>So, y know, sorry about that. But thanks.</p>
<p>It’s only what I’m putting myself through.</p>
<p>An eternal hoop trying to jump through itself.</p>
<p>The trickster god is a Creator. Sometimes religions — even often? I’m
not an expert! — they seem to have gone through a stage of divvying
things up, so that you end up with a more civilized geometer god who
fashions things, and then beyond he or she is the Real Creator or True
God, who breathes the breath by which any of that is possible in the
first place.</p>
<p>The trickster is the oneness of this pair. Which cannot be without
their twoness. The forgetting is necessary, non-axiomatically. Really
seeing this can be something like a why for death. And life. And
everything. And that there can be no everything. Eat set terror.</p>
<p>It is part of that constellation of thoughts concerning the
omnipotence of God. Could God make a rock so heavy that even She — even
She who has pectoral muscles so big there is no room left for boobies —
would not be able to — what’s that word they use? press? — lift it,
basically.</p>
<p>You don’t have to see it theologically, or indeed any other way, it
is essentially pure metaphysics, as well as the reason all this
<em>is</em>. That we are or can be said to be. Zero, infinity, whatever,
just think about it.</p>
<p>Or don’t, but don’t forget the value of those who do, and how very
many ways there are to.</p>
<p>My way, the way it happens to me… it sometimes quite hurts actually.
It is realer than real. I obviously can’t say “there is nothing abstract
about it”… but I feel it all very deeply. These ideas are more than
real, to or for me. Much realer than I am.</p>
<p>(Burt, maybeep knot thurn I AM, hey? Heheheek.)</p>
<p>I am we are ours. No mean feat to be able to understand, and thus
metaphoreally utter, such superverbal formulas…</p>
<p>(Awe, eek way shun zzz, wint they?)</p>
<p>OK, someone’s getting restless, I must have said enough for now.</p>

<hr />

<p>Disappointment then. The Five of Cups in particular.</p>
<p>So: yesterday I had a little breakthrough in my understanding of the
seven sevens, and the way in which they point to or relate to the
eights.</p>
<p>Say that the way I conceive of myself as an avatar of my trickster
god is not not as The Fool of the Tarot, and Crowley’s Thoth Tarot in
particular.</p>
<p>The way I imagine my goddess, who is necessarily a different kind of
trickster, possessing a kind of medicine, or correction… I guess we each
do something for the other, otherwise we wouldn’t be tricksters and none
of this would work, or not work, or not knotwork, or be playful enough,
as the headcase maybeep…</p>
<p>Anyway, I do think of her as Adjustment / Justesse, VIII in the Thoth
Tarot, but Amulet in my own universe. Or Amulet is one of the people she
is or could be, my wife is another and there are ways in which there
could be many more.</p>
<p>I saw the sevens as a kind of pyramid, that is also the ship I call
FriendShip, and it points to Amulet, who is the eighteenth eight knot,
for me. All this makes me feel as if the Great Pyramid is like a giant
arrow pointing back the way we came.</p>
<p>I’m getting a bit Ancient Aliens, I said to her.</p>
<p>Careful it’s a slippery slope, she smiled.</p>
<p>It’s all good peeps, this is just part of what it means to live the
Ultraterrestrial Good Life:</p>
<p>Tune in next episode for a complete mental breakdown!</p>
<p>No I’m kidding. I’ve mostly cured my insanity with madness, so most
episodes are more like breath — he, <em>break</em>throughs, now.</p>
<p>But I’m not kidding about the Ancient Aliens stuff, only that… it’s
something real to me, that the industry around it doesn’t quite touch,
or reach. The degree to which we have Cosmic Origins, I mean: that’s what
mythology is. Any one of us can do it, have our own ways to access the
many stories of this meaning, metaphorealize the ways in which they — we
— live.</p>
<p>(I am alone but we are not dot com. I’m snapping you up just as soon
as the internet returns!)</p>
<p>But yeah: <em>disappointment</em>.</p>
<p>I thought I would have a quick peep at the set of eight-crossing
knots, and see if anything jumped out at me concerning their relation to
the Trumps of the Tarot. The cards were kind of jammed in the box. I’d
set off the Trumps by wedging the little instruction booklet between them
and the rest of the deck, but the fit was too good. I tapped and tapped
and eventually they started coming out but they brought another card
with them. Disappointment, the Five of Cups. Quite a bugger of a
card.</p>
<p>The most obvious message concerned my being over eager, premature.
There is an antipathy in the card between Mars and Scorpio, Fire and
Water. He comes on too hot and scares her off. She wants to erode him
away nice and slow.</p>
<p>But there are more subtle and personal signs in there, that might
only unfold over time. The inverted pentagram might be someone else for
me. A pride that comes before a fall, but a fall that is necessary.</p>
<p>I am at my liberty to imagine, to hope for, strange redemptions
here.</p>
<p>Maybe the Trumps and these knots are not meant to correspond. Some
sort of cross-correspondence could be helpful in some ways, but I
shouldn’t forget that… I shouldn’t begin to believe that I’m just here
to put another spin on the Tarot.</p>
<p>Or maybe I am, but then I have to follow the knots, my thread, my
feelings, and not just try to translate or reapply an interpretation
that already exists. I must maintain focus on the pre-existing. Being Still, something between Justesse and the Fool, a who knows
what kind of story.</p>
<p>But the card is a warning. Feels like one. Feels like the kind of
warning I always get: checks on the strength of my more impulsive
head.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t be without it though.</p>
<p>But yeah, part of the Great Trick, the hinge of it all is something
like A (The) Right Way Up. I might not believe in Objective Reality, but
I do believe in A Way Of Things. There is a thread that joins us all
together, and it does have a certain orientation and a limit to what it
permits, which includes a very special sort of transgress.</p>
<p>My worry is that the knots, or not Not Knot Theory… that there is
potential here for… ha, well, just so long as the impossible is not what
they think it is, certain possibilities remain self-defeating. As do
some uncertain ones.</p>
<p>Anyway, all of this tension is necessary, at the end of the day we
are telling a story — at least I am, that’s what all this is the
groundwork of… I mean, in a sense this is the story itself: all this is
my quest. But what to me is revelation or disclosure… well, not all is
bad, concerning re-presentation. There is a reason it is sometimes
considered to be the essence of Art, surely that is an error, but just
as surely there is an art to, or of, it. A need, and a way, for things (I’m fed up with scarequoting that,
let’s just assume we actually know what we’re (not) talking about when
we say it, from now on)…</p>
<p>There is a need and a way for things that are disclosed to be
represented.</p>
<p>What we disclose for ourselves, which we must sometimes understand as
being revealed to us, is not necessarily a revelation for the masses —
even necessarily not — and herein lies the path to the art of
representation — even the thruth — ha! I like that, but I was of course
trying to write: even the <em>truth</em> of it.</p>
<p>What I think of Not Knot Theory as, is much closer to an odd sort of
language, than it is any kind of — for instance — religion. It is also
very clearly not a science: it begins from something more like a
hyperthesis — a moment of madness — than a calm and collected
hypothesis. It isn’t really even theoretical. But it is not anti any of
this. The echoing <em>not</em> there, the not not, that’s what all that’s about,
or one application of it.</p>
<p>Creativity, really, just that this is never not to think in terms of
Creation itself, for me. Just verb and noun really, just that it is more
as if there was — say my proper name or actual noun is Sam Knot — it
is as if there was an activity I could be doing that we could call Sam
Knotting. It is noun and verb like that, more than in the sense that Sam Knot
is waffling on again, for example…</p>
<p>(Not that that’s not not one of the things Sam Knotting must
mean!)</p>

<h2>16:36</h2>

<p>We are one step closer to living in a Smart Cottage.</p>
<p>It’s our first step. A giant leap for Samkind.</p>
<p>I bet you thought I was a Luddite, didn’t you? All this talk about
God and Vegetables. (I did mention Vegetables didn’t I?)</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m not. I live in a Smart Cottage. A rural vision for the
future. Tomorrow’s World today.</p>
<p>Okay, you’re probably hungry for details aren’t you? You like this kind
of modern techno stuff don’t you? It makes us feel more relevant. Better
than going on about the culture wars and my moles and god and
intersexual organs anyway isn’t it?</p>
<p>It’s a lightbulb.</p>
<p>I purchased a smart lightbulb, because I wanted something fancy to go
in the new unnecessary light-fixing in the recently redecorated
bathroom. Little spot above the mirror above the sink, where some random
wires were dangling down, classic French Country Living chic. Thought
I’d put a light there. A simple outdoor one a bit like you’d find on a
ship. A boat, I mean. Although, just now it is doing quite a good job
of</p>
<p>broken spaceship.</p>
<p>We haven’t got the internet, see, so I can’t connect to it to tell it
what I want it to do, with the app and that, so it’s just flipping out,
flashing off and on, doing</p>
<p>broken spaceship.</p>
<p>I don’t think you’re very smart, I says to it, if I was a fancy colour-changing lightbulb and someone just switched
me on… well, I guess I would default to showing off a bit? Doing a
little dance in all my different outfits? I wouldn’t just be a normal
white lightbulb turning myself off and on.</p>
<p>That’s the problem with smart stuff: it’s all a bit stupid. House of
cards kind of clever. Trust in mama-science-god type stuff.</p>
<p>Good job I quite like broken spaceship.</p>
<p>I left it flashing while I cleaned up the dust and stuff I’d made
from drilling into the wall, all the little bits of wire.</p>
<p>Chou came in while I was doing it. I shouted to warn her that the
house was malfunctioning. I noticed my face had a mad grin on it. The
flashing light really suited it. I am enjoying this. Some of us really
thrive in an Apocalypse — I don’t mean the ones who are getting rich off
it, they’re as sick and insane as most everyone else: The mad ones.</p>
<p>We likes broken spaceship. Finds it invigorating.</p>
<p>Losing pressure but…</p>
<p>It’s just like the crack where the light gets in isn’t it?</p>
<p>Not really much difference between the face in the mirror and the
deep dark void of space, is there? Really?</p>
<p>All just the laughter of a Mad God.</p>
<p>Nothing to be scared of.</p>
