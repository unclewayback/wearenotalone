<h1>January 27th, 2023</h1>
<h2>08:15, WB</h2>

<p>I was driving you about, old friend. Pretty much knew where we were
headed, so you’d slackened off on the map, but now I needed it.
Tea-stained old thing it was, not your usual roadmap, though it had the
motorways marked on it, the forests were drawn in evocatively, and the
mountains almost like people.</p>
<p>We were off to Blake’s Cottage, but it sure as phelp wasn’t in
Felpham. Somewhere deep in the midst of the island, a place with plenty
highs and lows. We knew it stood at the top of a village that climbed up
the slopes of someone, that famous postcard of it sat on the dashboard,
the highest spot in town. This must’ve been one of the houses he lived
in <em>after</em> he died.</p>
<p>We reached a grassy car park on a terrace and saw one of a coach load
of tourists pointing back past us with wide eyes, saying in an over-awed voice:
There it is ! But I was more interested in the scene which was
blossoming just there behind them: it is a beautiful pure blue sky, mid
afternoon on a goldilocks day, until a little patch of sunset bruises
the midst of it.</p>
<p>Now everybody is watching that instead. They are clearly all
Apocalypse Virgins, oohing and aahing over the pretty colours while I
brace myself. That whole half of the sky is soon boiling and roiling
with a curtain of fiery purple cloud, and then the dragon of the night
steps out: great void horned lizard phoenix swinging some awful
something towards our overheads with a perspective we cannot quite
comprehend.</p>
<p>There is general panic now. What you have to hope to understand in such situations is
that the battle is between what you can see and forces invisible. The
crispy eagle of doom is advancing upon nothing. It is one sort of
nothing testing itself against another kind. The other kind of nothing
is not over there behind us — the still blue sky into which the
apparently Great One is crossing — no, it is inside us, and The Thing
cannot see it unless we give ourselves away.</p>
<p>The key is just to keep looking out.
That warped talon doesn’t look like it’s coming down on us but I’ll bet
you it is — just keep an eye on it. Keep looking out, and feeling
that which is inside you as back up. It has your back. The greatest
mistake would be to turn and try to look at <em>that</em>. That <em>this,</em>
you know? The kind of ‘thing’ you can only say by waggling yer owlbrows? Try to
look at that and the Uncreature will no longer be passing over. He’ll be
stepping through the door of your bloody face, right into the main
event.</p>
<p>The sooty talon skewers a few accidents on its way to the real
horizon and disappears. The way dreams don’t.</p>

<p>Gulli hovers around the front garden while the others are busy with
their heads in the hay. She wants her medicine. Well, she wants her
treat, it just so happens to be a medicine. Thyme pellets on a bed of
luzerne, to help with her hay allergy. Bloody fiery sensitive gingers
!</p>
<p>Mummy doesn’t want to give her her medicine until after she has eaten
hay, because the hay will just push the good stuff right out of her
belly. Just ignore her, Mummy says, but Daddy has other ideas.</p>
<p>Daddy tries chasing her into the stable with the others, but she
escapes and trots away whenever he traps her near the door. Daddy takes
a handful of hay and beseeches her, come, eat. She stands near the
feeding station stubbornly. Daddy puts the hay in the broken
wheelbarrow, maybe that will be the message that gets through?</p>
<p>It is not that I care about <em>her</em>, he smiles.</p>
<p>No, Mummy agrees, she is just the <em>bearer</em>.</p>
<p>Gulli continues to hover and pester. It is not hay in the
wheelbarrow, but thought. I suppose it is a bit much to expect her to
<em>think.</em></p>
<p>Daddy suggests giving her just the luzerne, without the thyme, to
break her beastly fixation, and then to hit her with the actual dose
later. Mummy will try the idea. She comes across the yard with an old
saucepan full of dusty dark green treats, fiery Gulli trying to
intercept every step of the way.</p>
<p>The big ginger lump is eating now. The others have all come to watch.
Even Dreki, Dreki the ever empty, has left her spot in the hay in the
hopes of a different flavour.</p>

<p>Clearly, it is a fool’s errand to sort through the vast multiverse at
random to find one resembling our actual universe, no matter how powerful
our supercomputers become.<br />
<em>– Ehrlich, Hunting the Faster than Light Tachyon, p.107</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this what Count Roundabout is up to? Even worse, or better: is he
in fact double checking the supercomputerror’s results? A metafool’s
errond? And this the black monk’s cell at the heart of Asylum,
somehow..?</p>
<p>Well, the heart would be in the pulsatory dynamic between that and
Amulet’s metaphoreal breakout — which is itself an echo — or the
reverse-time cause — of the City’s foundation myth.</p>
<p>Asylum doesn’t become Real until the moment the window opens in the
wall and the thing itself is broken out of. When the prison break is
what realizes the prison we have created I Am We Our Prism. Zzz.</p>

<p>Oh, how true this, from p.109:</p>

<p>Cryonics might even prove more feasible than humanity agreeing on a
small set of universal goals!</p>

<h2>11:38</h2>

<p>I had wanted to record the finding of the calender yesterday.</p>
<p>After stopping at the library and scrawling a poem I went on to the église
Saint-Pierre. On the welcome table there was a calender: <em>2023 sous le
regarde de la Sainte Vierge.</em> I wanted it. I had a flick through: a collection of historical scenes in a classical oil
painting style with a little explanation written
underneath. It had the saint of each day in the little day boxes.
Vercingetorix was on the cover, beseeching the Emperor of Rome through a
moustache I could imagine swaying like a hunting dog’s ears. Surely
it was meant for me ?</p>
<p>I figured I could put some coins in the charity box and just take it. I
paced around shiftily waiting for the coast to clear even though the
only other person was clearly a fellow mental. I figured it might even
be intended that someone <em>should</em> take it, but that there was
only one made me doubt it. I turned it over and looked at the back, in
small print near the bottom it said: <em>ce calendrier ne peut être vendu</em>. I
popped it in my bag right quick and did a celebratory circuit as the
nuns — glimpsed fluttering through the great columns for all the world
like white doves — began their chants.</p>
<p>The great windows letting in the stainless light through their
beautiful geometric designs. The distant presence of that disappearing
ceiling. That particular, fresh but sombre, outside in kind of feeling,
from a special sort of earth that only gets made in corners. Passing a
grieving goddess in the corridor of a dying god as my own footsteps
sound the immortal whisper. What is this place ? this religion ? I
thought.</p>
<p>Once home I revealed my bounty to the wife. She thought it was funny
that we would spend 2023 under the gaze of the Virgin. She reckoned they
would be happy I had taken their calender, imagining they had made a
convert. <em>Tradition, Famille, Propriété.</em> If only they knew how
not not wrong they were not not ! Would they recognise the goddess in
the hearth of this happy pervert ? Would they even recognise themselves
in the faceless mirror of that final gently rippling spring ? Do even I
know what I am talking about ?</p>
<p>I thought I did.</p>
<p>Or else I did, before I thought.</p>
<p>I <em>do</em>.</p>
<p>I just say it like a vow, is all.</p>
<p>The way we all have our own vows not not to make and not not to
break.</p>
<p>I don’t like her face though, Chou. That is the one aspect of this
calender I could really do without.</p>
<p>There is a much better model in l’église Saint-Pierre, only at the
moment it is away for repair. It is a touch more primitive but a world
more beautiful.</p>
<p>I might have to find a photo of it to stick over that horribly
unhorrible face: to think of slapping the Virgin every day will make my
bottom blush !</p>
<p>It is a soft and slightly pudgy kind of frozen, her visage. A
porcelin travesty on a tasteless and over-crowded shelf.</p>
<p>Precisely the kind of thing that makes Protestants want to smash
stuff !</p>

<p>(Saint Jean Chrysostome, it is today.<br />
(Opening to Christ, could it be?<br />
(That’ll learn me.)))</p>

<h2>15:10</h2>

<p>Wife came into the bathroom to tell me she was dying as I was
varnishing the wood.</p>
<p>That back pain she had been talking about, she was worried it could
be the symptom of a heart attack.</p>
<p>I am becoming one of those things, what did you call it ?</p>
<p>A hypochondriac ?</p>
<p>Yes !</p>
<p>It is just that it is common among women of my age to ignore such
symptoms. Some women die before they are 50 from heart attacks.</p>
<p>So what will you do about it ? Will you go to the Doctor ?</p>
<p>No, I will just keep an eye on it.</p>
<p>Okay, just don’t add to your stress by stressing about your stress.</p>
<p>Okay, but if I die please don’t keep the horses. I have already told
Agnes to make sure you won’t. Just sell them, or kill them if you have
to. Boby will have to be killed.</p>
<p>Sorry Chou, this is the Winding Brook Sanctuary for Ultraterrestrial
Life, remember ? We don’t kill animals unless we’re really really
hungry.</p>
<p>I just don’t want you to be one of those people who hold on to the memory
of their loved ones by being miserable and suffering. I want you to be
happy. Sell this place. Have a nice life.</p>
<p>No ! I won’t do it. It’s not just you that I married. I will keep this
place and I will worship you every day with my misery. I will make
myself a slave to horse shit in your memory.</p>
<p>I am not going to die.</p>
<p>Oh ? I was starting to look forward to it. It would be very poetic, a
dead wife. It has made some poet’s careers.</p>
<p>No, I am too old already, it wouldn’t be romantic.</p>
<p>I don’t know, I could probably do something with it. But let’s just
stick to the plan shall we ? Still rather a lot to do !</p>

<hr />

<h2>18:50</h2>

<p>Just finished my friday afternoon rounds, got to go give the bathroom
its second coat, but I just wanted to mention that lovely light we
had…</p>
<p>That lovely low late winter sun shining in under the dark grey clouds
making all the bare branches super beautiful, all the muddy fields
a-glow, even the boring buildings seem to smile.</p>
<p>I’m zooming along the little stretch of motorway on my way to the
farm after the shops in La Haye and I feel compelled to wind down my
window and shout into the wind: You really do look lovely this evening !
Then I wind that window up and wind down the passenger one and shout out
that side: I was just saying, I don’t what it is, if you’ve done
something with your Sun or your Clouds or something, but you really do
look lovely this evening !</p>
<p>Really lovely !</p>
