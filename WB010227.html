<p>Oh, I finished the Tàin last night — too much fighting for me in the
end. Good to read but we ain’t going back there.</p>
<p>Love is a little like single-combat sometimes, that’s about as close
as I can get to endorsing any beauty or glory I did find in it. Which I
did, just in the end it didn’t really seem to be about that. Fuck being
about, I know, at least there were some gems among us. I don’t want to
change it or them, I’m not really judging them, I’m saying how I feel
now. Those battlefields are just too much. Who wants to live in a world
where virtually every placename commemorates a slaying? Maybe more than
once upon a time these will be… something else. But still.</p>
<p>There are animals between us and hell, working just the same way real
saints and other beat poets do in the human world. Seeking an end to
what? If it feels like everything, we still have work to do. They say
good deeds can help. Pretty sure it’s not the size that counts, nor any
other way the world tends to measure. You know the score.</p>

<p>off to beddage, farewell until next time fevrier, whose name comes
from purging (and woodlice do breathe out their bum, and mummies carry
their bubs around in a pouch of sorts, and some peeps call them cheesey
pigs)</p>
<p>i hurt. not much point in saying it but i do. the old injury. we’ll
be ok. i can’t tell if it’s just that i’m getting old, or if just
working harder than ever before, or if diet not up to scratch or
something. figure it oot. fare ye well fevrier, sure there was some good
words in amongst the mass of it.</p>
