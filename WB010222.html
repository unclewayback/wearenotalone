<h1>23rd February</h1>
<h2>08:00</h2>

<p>Something whispers:</p>
<p><em>there is a world outside the outside world, go
out, go out and keep going, don’t let them convince you it doesn’t exist
or you never won’t, you’ll never come to not even nothing, go out and
keep going to find the truth of what seems inside you, the source the
seat of your awareness — your being is in the world outside the outside
world, inside it seems because you have to pass through, dig the hole
find the door seek the star of the sky warren, inside it seems because
of how you are used to being used, locked away inside a trick so obvious
it hides — who is behind the face of the day when it smiles? who is
behind the eyes of the night when they scowl? — it is outside outside
and when you arrive you will see that where you came from is outside,
each outside is outside the other and there is no inside but between,
and no between but what seems a way from one to the other, the
appearance of the other from one — but we are flush, there is not even
nothing between us, contact is complete, we are endless completion, the
only complexity there is, with nothing to complicate it — get going, keep
coming, come…</em></p>

<hr />

<p>It took some time for the qualities of the little bunny to begin to
show through the vague veneer of not-quite-naturally selected cuteness.
He was a dwarf and at first seemed a little deformed.</p>
<p>I’m not quite
sure about his big male head, Madame Knot said, in a message with a
photo attached.</p>
<p>Mister Knot was in England. It was the first time he’d been out in
eighteen months, the first time he’d seen anyone apart from the lady in
the farm shop. That Covid thing was happening. His Grandfather was close
to death and he had a new niece who he hadn’t seen yet, so despite his
reservations about the technological form of the vaccine (and the manner
in which it was being insisted upon) he had rolled up his sleeve and taken
one for the team. Now he was back in England and able to hug his sister
and kiss his niece and hold the hand of his dying grandad — it had been
a year and a half since he had touched anyone but his wife.</p>
<p>Now here was this message from her, with a photo of the new arrival. The
rabbit looked caught in the act somehow, a bit like the Yeti in that
famous photo: just out for a stroll, or off for a hop, then snap —
suddenly noticing someone watching you in the same moment they snatch a
photo, steal a little slice of your soul. He was aware. Awkwardly aware. He
was really there. It was very clear that the bunny was <em>someone</em>. A new
person had arrived in our lives. He was hopping around the room trying
to avoid my wife.</p>
<p>Madame Knot, you mean?</p>
<p>Yes, sorry. What a joke. This wasn’t even meant to be about me. I
thought third person might help. I had just meant to set the scene a
bit. Begin to explain why I was depressed, how I came to be aggravated
again, by the thought that I had somehow failed to have a family, to be
the person I was meant to be. The person I <em>should</em> have been, according
to certain other persons and parts of myself.</p>
<p>So are we doing this or what?</p>
<p>I don’t know… having looked back over it I think we better had. The
writing doesn’t start to flow until you are actually just sharing of
yourself, and if you want to use this as some kind of springboard into
another world you’re going to need to gather some momentum. What if this
is your way out? I mean, it’s not really <em>in</em> is it? It’s definitely a
kind of through. It is at least a kind of through. This is how you’ve
pulled yourself through, apart from the help and support of others, the
love… but there’s nothing to love without this, is there? There’s no one
without this process of you feeding back into yourself. This is where
and why you are really growing, growing nowhere as it maybe, but how
you’ve learnt to see that it’s really getting somewhere. Too many people
are getting nowhere. You are growing it. You are a ruin. You are what
every pie in the sky will become, the blancmange at the bottom of every
stupidly skeletal ladder. Only the men in suits could make you imagine
yourself proud to be a kind of pink jelly! Spaceship builders my arse.
You cunts wouldn’t know a portal if…</p>
<p>Nothing to hate, either. Nothing to love nothing to hate without this
non-script of your real life written in the happening of it, written
back and forth all throughout it, this great knot of yourself that you
are linking up with others, other adventurers, other people who’ve come
this way, who <em>are</em> this way, sea people and sky people and anyone who
makes themselves able to visualise and then cross this kind of bridge,
anyone who recognises themselves in it.</p>
<p>So it has changed. It wasn’t what you thought it was. It was more
like what it already was, what it’s always been and all ways will be.
Mad, wild, cute… even cosy, for the right kind of freak. However many
legs or not we’ve got a corner for you here at Winding Brook. Here at
the Winding Brook Sanctuary for Ultraterrestrial Life.</p>

<hr />

<p>The working title becomes something more Rabbit Hole-y.</p>
<p>(Rabbit Holier Than Thou?)</p>
<p>You want to remind yourself, loudly enough that anyone may hear, like
a mad person in the street…</p>
<p>You are becoming fiction. It doesn’t mean what they think it does.
Becoming is not becoming and fiction is not fiction. But you are. You
are.</p>
<p>There are things the world thinks unreal, or just a ‘kind of’ real, and
this is who you are going to join, these are the peoples you are moving
towards.</p>
<p>It is madness, but not folly. It would be folly to try to convince
people who don’t really exist of a world which does. You will become
fiction, you will write a path, draw a line between and beyond with your
life, your story, your being what you are. Away with the fairies. Away
with me, hear hear to who is already here. A way with words, just like
the river says… a way with words away away…</p>
<p>This is not metafiction. You can tag it that if you need to in the
meantime but that’s not me. That’s not what I think meta means. I know
it as Among. I am Among. Among I will be. I am not About. I am not
referencing my ‘self’ and nor am I conscious of being fiction, nor do I
believe I am a text. I know what I am and I know what this is.</p>
<p>This rabbit hole is Portal Tech. The Portal I am we are ours.</p>
<p>I have to come across in certain ways because the ghosts of time have
certain flavours. I have to hate the way I sound sometimes and say it
anyway. There is no other way, there is no trying not to. The Resistance
are doing it anyway, not trying not to sound like or seem like they are
not doing somethink they’re not. That shit is up to you.</p>
<p>You want to insist there is an Objective Reality just because there
is an Absolute Truth, fine, but what if the Absolute Truth is that there
is no Objective Reality? The one meaning infinitely real?</p>
<p>The only instrument that could ever reveal something like this would
be a musical one.</p>
<p>Eek.</p>
