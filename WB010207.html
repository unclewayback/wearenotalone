<p>The Abyss Is Identity</p>
<p>I wonder if it was just one of the twins who said that to me</p>
<p>Or if it was the look in their eyes</p>
<p>A look in ours, something that passed between us</p>
<p>And could not, at the same time</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>Like the difference between Not Not and literally everything,
anything, nothing…</p>
<p>Limit cases. Illustrative. Non-linearity is the norm. Not that it
ever could be normalized. Linearity is a limit case. It is actually
non-non-linearity. Clearly, that non-non- is not Not Not. Non. C’est
evident.</p>
<p>The finite is, in ph*ct, the inin- or uninfinite. This is the not
not-something which disappears: the un un becomes the, um, just the
something, you know, without the awkweird dooblah negrotives what we
don’t even see anywayzzz. What we do not see, is a disappearance, an
unmagical trick, the not not-something Not Not is not. Not Not never
appeared in the first place, never seemed. It is not insight, but
realization, whose art is metaphorealization.</p>
<p>Yeah you go Big Wiz shpeaks it loike ye mean zit. Pop!</p>
<p>Sho, ye shee… no, look:</p>
<p>I am looking into, out of, the twin’s eyes. So long are they are,
they could be anything. They are not being and not being. Being is not
ununbeing, not nonnonexistence, it is Not Not. This is the Abyss. They
are serious. Or at least one of them is, and looking at the other one,
you realize why she thinks she better be. She <em>knows</em>. He will
come to understand.</p>
<p>The infinite of which the finite is the uninfinite of is not the
infinite we think we know, which is indeed the un of that finite, say
the unfinite. Our everyday infinity is the infinity of a finity which is
itself a forgetting, blindness, or ignorance. But how can you be blind
to what cannot be seen?</p>
<p>Simply don’t go looking. Some things cannot be unseen, especially the
unseen. The tangles in these phrases, the apparent ambiguities in these
formulations: they are no more a bug than your own features. These many
senses are some of the ways the imagination itself perceives the world
that makes it. Senses, meanings, are openings in the body of the soul:
The abyss that is the oneness of the twins, which is not and never was
their source any more than it is the end of them. It is their
realization, which would strike us as derealization, and so the Wizard,
thee Wiz-tard, finds themselves drinking and sharing — which is which
and who is whom — the poison and the medicine of metaphorealization.</p>
<p>Poetry, say. If that was something you could find in a place.</p>
<p>Singing, if the melodies were beings who were enchanted by your
finding them charming, and so leapt through you, leaving the traces of
themselves for which we have no word but feeling.</p>
<p>Feeling is a good word, trust me, it is one of our best. It is going
back along the way we’ve come, and it is just the kind of scout that can
be trusted. It can pick up a lot, absorb very much, without becoming
weighed down. Just keeps on getting lighter on its feet.</p>
<p>Say Not Not is the twins, then, with the caveat that the realization
is that… that is <em>is</em> them. One we could call thought and the
other feeling. There is no unlanguage, just as nonsense makes sense. The
things we might think of as ‘in-themselves’, or prior to or before…
potential. Possible.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Virtual really is a better word, it just has nothing to do with
Virtual Reality is all. It does have something to do with simulation,
but nothing to do with fakery or falseness, more to do with imagination.
It is a bit like the possible, only there is nothing unnecessary about
it. It is more like the similarity of the twins, than any kind of game
they might be playing. It is the Abyss.</p>
<p>Crossing is the senses we make of this, the senses we are made of,
the making and the breaking of us. Not Not The Cross. The Tree.</p>
<p>You can get this much more drily from some folk, if you just want to
<em>think</em> that you understand, but if you want to experience
creativity, if you feel the need to <em>feel</em> it… well, this is the
way I have ended up going. Same fucking way I started out. Wayback.</p>
<p>I know it seems a slog. It is sometimes. But we walk, these are the
creatures we are. What we do and what we are is twins. The real twins
create admit or permit what they are not… I mean, what else is
Creation?</p>
<p>But this is Not Not, if not it would be evil, and they would be good
instead of The Good.</p>
<p>Just spit out your poison clarity regarding the nature of infinity
cocksnake, you are boring me. Sorry.</p>
<p>It’sss ok, I underssstand. I am underssstanding.</p>
<p>(One of the twins probably hasss a lisssp.)</p>
<p>We begin from finity, which is the forgetting or eclipse of its own
source. We develop a concept of infinity ‘in light’ of this finity, and
that is what we take infinity to be. So, perhaps I should say finity is
the forgetting and infinity is the eclipse. There is no bridge from
this, no path going back — we cannot salmon swim back upstream to find
the real or true infinity — this is the Abyss — here it is. It never
left, except to provisionally become left, if that can be at all
helpful, if not fine, it’s alright, forget about it.</p>
<p>The Actual Infinity, which we could call The Virtual, is what we mean
when we say Imagination, so that is what we will call it, because it is
closer to our hearts, and more profoundly a part of our own line of
work, and it doesn’t intend a set of categories like Virtual Actual Real
can seem to. It never pretends to make that much sense. Another way of
saying it is Definitely Infinite.</p>
<p>This is the Not Not. We develop infinity as not-finity, but if we try
to… if we want to understand what is on the otherside of that…</p>
<p>It all seems a knot, now. There is much to be said for being more
sober about it. If you just play with the simple logical forms for long
enough, and if you make yourself the variable — your I the x — that is
probably better than me getting caught up in my own web.</p>
<p>I remember now why I thought just to draw it, diagram it.</p>
<p>I think all I wanted to get to this morning was being able to show,
for us to see, to feel and to know, how the biggest difference in the
world, in all the worlds, is that which opens up between identical
twins. Not human ones: Gods. They have been human, in my world, and in
fact — they <em>are</em> Gods — this is what we are. What we are Not
Not.</p>
<p>I wanted to give an instance of or example of this, of this proximity
which is the abyss who is the ex of a person, an imp of un purr sun zzz,
from witch creation springs, pours forth. It is deep what I say and how
I feel it. It is wrapped right up with ancient stories, the myth of the
fall, the murder of the godman, the death of the shaman… it is gnosis,
and goddess… but it is different about things, different about the
demiurge, different about christ jesus… different from those who are
different, too. This is why it has to be a story for me. A whole world
of stories. It only seems like philosophy. I can appreciate the ways we
are similar… but that’s just what I am saying. Here is where the biggest
difference is.</p>
<p>It is like ‘the curve’ of pure exponentiation, as doubling, at root.
There is one twin. Then you look at the Prime numbers, and you see how
very different the powering of one must be. How very different is unity.
It couldn’t even grow, really. Instead it just looks like a patternless
thing, something very definite, as definite as the definition of what a
prime number is, and yet as chaotic in practice, as essentially
non-algorithmic and yet a product of simplicity. You zoom in on the
primal ‘curve’ and you see this, you zoom out far enough and its looks
just like, exactly the same as, doubling, exponentiation. Here is the
other twin.</p>
<p>The problem is that this is not meant to illustrate the two twins,
but rather them on one side and what they are not on the other.</p>
<p>It is as if I said: the primes are the infinite, and the ‘squares’
(even three is a cube in this mode), are the finite. But what I wanted
to say was: the primal is the definitely infinite, who are in fact the
twins, and the exponential is the finite and the infinite as we define
them — as they appear to mutually define or delimit each other — which
is in fact just a way of knowing who the twins are not, so it is like a
kind of twinning the twins are twinned with, but really it has nothing
to do with what the twins are, what the twins do, which is the twine-ing
of the True, which cannot be not, and so has to be negatively, which
should seem impossible, except it is precisely what we try to understand
as the possible, the meaning of which is a key to shattering illusion,
and seeing everything primally.</p>
<p>As it is.</p>
<p>So this <em>is</em> a kind of game the twins are playing, just that
the game of games is precisely not a game. This is how serious the root
of sillyness is. Almost literally the root of it, the inverse of its
primal doubling. But hang on, I was close to just saying enough of what
I set out to to stop.</p>
<p>And I see a mystery, which looks like a mistake I could be
making.</p>
<p>I am trying to point to the difference between the twins — their
identity — as being that which makes them more different — infinitely
further apart — than that which we normally, or even paranormally or
unusually, think of as different. Like a dog and a cat or a number and a
suitcase or… not quite a man and a woman, they — we — are more like the
twins. Not light and leaf. It isn’t easy, trying to paint in this way.
You understand that though, now, if you didn’t already: how it is
precisely in identity that the abyss is opening up, presencing
itself.</p>
<p>I sam — huh, I am — I am trying to say <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>Which is precisely not this non-identity that I then keep pointing
out: not the difference between, or sameness of, the twins… but the
unreal difference or non-sameness of ‘something’ compared with them, or
that.</p>
<p>MC Sam Knot, compere without compare, welcome to the haunted
microphone and all this-that.</p>
<p>May every seat be throne.</p>
<p>Not here today, hare tomorrow.</p>
<p>Hang me up a minute, don’t just hang on forever.</p>
<p>I’ll be back, as if I’ve really gone somewhere.</p>
<p>May every seat be throne.</p>

<p>Feed the birds.</p>
<p>That’s my graffiti, though I didn’t spray it, nor suggest it.</p>
<p>The semi-wild gardener’s slow self-burial beneath the never-changing
sky.</p>
<p>Feed the birds.</p>
<p>Protesty McProtester says it is the protester’s protest. It is, and
this kind of stuff is what meta really means.</p>
<p>It has literally nothing to do with getting trapped between two
mirrors.</p>
<p>But everything to do with looking into one.</p>
<p>Which is not not — Not Not — a mirror. More like a reflection though,
than anything too two-way. Still: something we can see through.</p>
<p>I realise that today, or earlier today: this is what happens to me
when I sit down with something I think I need to say. I think it is
worse than yesterday: messier, more convoluted and perhaps unhelpfully
twisted. All good though, in this context which is never not (Not Not)
Cosmic.</p>
<p>Chaosmickey taking. Auto-chaosmic-y giv-n-t-aching. Stay on it
sunshine.</p>
<p>I realize — or this is an insight I intend to realize — that I am
better off writing without the need to be saying anything, or speaking
without believing I am really saying something — and making pictures,
drawing or painting, what it is I feel I really want to say. This, in
fact, says it better than any amount of the waffley stuff above.</p>
<p>There was something else, he thinks, then realizes</p>
<p>The Something Else <em>was</em> Something Else!</p>
<p>If you can both go: yeah, when is it ever not; and: man, that is a
real realization uncle brother sister blisster, mindblown.</p>
<p>Mindblown.</p>
<p>Nevermindblown.</p>
<p>Soul breathing. Soul good. Calmer, calmer.</p>
<p>In fact it is kind of a shame what I have to say. I have to say it
like I’m trying to tell you something, or it can seem like that, or feel
like it. I guess with Something Else we always have to be and not be
what we’re talking about, like with poetry.</p>
<p>That’s an idea. I could make it a poem. A silly one, hopefooly.</p>

<h3>The Third Room</h3>

<p>Let’s call it that.</p>
<p>That room is for its, and this room is for thats.</p>
<p>If you have a problem with this</p>
<p>—or that—</p>
<p>The Third Room is a very good solution.</p>
<p>The Third Thing can solve all kinds of problems.</p>
<p>But it can also be our problem. It is mine, kind of. Might even be
why I am kind of kind. To some degree.</p>
<p>It is The Something Else Box. The Box which is not a box.</p>
<p>If you find yourself in it then, whatever you do don’t try to get
out.</p>
<p>The Other Rooms are not for you now.</p>
<p>They never were.</p>
<p>And thus, why not purr hahahaps         imagine</p>
<p>They never were.</p>
<p>How could you walk back into one of them, then, let alone why?</p>
<p>Welcome to the other world, fellow dead person, unfallow dude
metaphorce.</p>
<p>Welcome to The World Outside The Outside World.</p>
<p>Remember to warn them, especially when they are us:</p>
<p>The Third Room is a really good solution to problems, in general, and
the problem of the general in particular.</p>
<p>It is also quite handy if your problem is solutions, but in a very
different way.</p>
<p>Never forget</p>
<p>You Are Something Else</p>
<p>(witch is why wiz tards like us can only I am not, and why is is Not
Not, as well as why knot, thus how… how important it is to understand…
be aware… it is a kind of antipoetry — this very Something Else itself —
as if To Be or Not To Be really was the question, and we began to
imagine Not Not To Be was some kind of an answer, as opposed to a
dissolution to not-my-problem. Is this rhetoric? Was that a rhetorical
question? Is this…?)</p>
<p>You really are something else. An impossible cat. A rusty old tuning
fork. A significantly unspecial kind of surprising. A freak in a way we
can’t all be, no matter how equilibrius you imagine yer
egalihilaritease.</p>
<p>Imagine the chaos that would result…</p>
<p>Where would I ever take a poo if all the world wanted to use The
Third Room at the same infinitely definabubble time?</p>
<p>Pack a folding shovel and head for the wills.</p>
<p>(The hills, I meme. Wed furr thee hills. Thou Wyld Zzz.)</p>
<p>See you in the underground.</p>
<p>The undergrowth.</p>
<p>Feed the birds.</p>
<p>Make up your own titles.</p>
<p>Keep rabbiting on.</p>
<p>Or in. Awe…</p>
<p>Under and in, over and out.</p>
