<h1>January 25th, 2023</h1>
<h2>07:17, WB</h2>

<p>It is Wednesday, says the little scrap of a dustbin schedule we use
instead of a calender this year. I’m better with the date than the day.
I think I will make my own calender next year — start an annual (durr)
Winding Brook calender. Or calenderender. Awe calenderenderror. Eek.</p>
<p>Had one of those moments yesterdodd when I saw myself as irrevocably
oblique. Not, actually. This just an overreaction to delving into old
materials and finding them even less comprehensible than I thought they
might be at the time. It is not everything I do, just sometimes seems a
larger percentage than expected.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking communication difficulties. Tempting even to split
it into different people, all using the same set of mouth-pulling
unhandles and blah-blah tokens. Mister Pass-the-butter is nice and
direct and makes a good dinner party guest, at least a somewhat reliable
one. Nothing wrong with him hey fellow?</p>
<p>But who is that wordy worm-tongue bird-heart trying to say what? It
is one thing to write it down and unrecite it silently in the privacy of
ones own unliving doom, quite another to go splashing it all about in
the communal swimming pool of our day-to-day business. Metaphoreally
mixed-up fool trying to use the lilo of our lingo to tilt its windmill
towards our speedboat!</p>
<p>No, the idea is more… that there is something or someone in me who
does somehow need to quite deeply fuck with the language it has been
given in order to express itself. The issue is whether or not that is
actually someone with something to say, or if it isn’t simply the 
emotional bottom burps of Mister Pass-the-butter.</p>
<p>It does seem like language itself is leading me astray sometimes
too. None of this was really what I wanted to say, and now I feel
whatever that was getting further away. I know that it wasn’t easy to
say somehow, emotionally, and that is part of what I wonder: if the
somersaulting wordage isn’t just the unintentional warpage of a psychic
knot?</p>
<p>And if so, would that be one of those knots folk would consider it
unlucky to untie?</p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, I feel I can say this: that somehow I have
not been given, or not been able to find, in what is commonly available,
something that some part of me feels it needs in order to express
itself.</p>
<p>Likely this is part of the feeling of poetry or art, but it is not
separate from what I could consider my run-of-the-mill communication
problems. Or, seeing as how most would find me a good communicator in
normal conversation, then what appears a communication problem to me is
actually some kind of emotional issue, and one that is deeply wound up
with whatever my, at least, creativity might be.</p>
<p>It appears a communication problem to me because it is mostly myself
I am struggling to make sense to, although not of — I mean I am trying
to make sense of more than just myself, it is just that… how do you make
sense of anything else if you cannot make sense of yourself? But then,
if the self itself is non-existent nonsense…</p>

<h2>13:34</h2>

<p>I have been thinking about making a collage of my notebooks and photographs in the form of an eScroll.
It could start with a perforation mark and a comment to the effect that the entirety of the history of
everything prior to this point is metaphorical Bog Roll. Toilet Paper.
And the entire history of the human race, or Cosmic Ethnicity or
whatever it is, is akin to this perforated line. This line that is just
an easy-rip point between the everything before and the potential
nothing after. The point being that, even if our story is taken to reach
200,000 years back (forgetting the Ultraterrestrial Hypothesis for the
moment, as well as the impossibility of really separating cause from
effect, at all) it is still just a perforation between everything and
nothing, and the most we can hope for, which is still really rather a
lot, is that we might one day be part of something that amounts to a
single-sheet of two-ply toilet paper, which is itself probably just one
of many rolls in the almost forgotten cupboard of a rather foresightful,
or at least insightful, Superrorentity who somehow manages to feel not
that much more significant than you, as not even the writer of this
nonsensical nothinghood, would, if you were me imagining that you might
never exist, or something.</p>

<hr />

<p>(Oh yes, that was it: Origami Hospital. That was the name of the
hospital I hope to go to if I ever have to go back in to one. I only
thought of it because of the scroll/bogroll train of thought: I was thinking, if we do
manage to make our story as significant as a sheet of sheet paper,
rather than just hanging around at the perforation here, forever, then I
will give us extra points for folding ourselves up into some kind of
Hospitable Origami as a sign of respect for the next divine arsehole
who happens to occupy this Universal Room.)</p>

<h2>17:48</h2>

<p>The bathroom has been retitled The Throne Room. It is that, for me,
the toilet (in particular our little écopot) : The Throne of All Good
Thin Kings. I do enjoy a good shit thought, as you know, and have not
gotten too fat off the back of my people. It really is a peaceful place
now, too. Clean and bright, white and light green, chrome and tile and
wood and glass. Plants.</p>
<p>I’ve just been fitting the toilet today, you see, mounting the wooden
box over the old concrete footing, which we will keep in place for the
time being. I made a bespoke wooden toilet roll holder as well, which
holds up to 8 rolls. I put my beer on top and sat on my throne and
surveyed my realm. It is a gentle, happy country, none too shy of giggle
or parp.</p>
<p>Just missing a few final touches, like the Winding Brook notice board
— a cork board next to the loo that I want to pin our first map to,
alongside the obligatory funny bunny postcards. It is my office, too,
you see. Office, Throne Room, Great Hall: the secret spiritual heart of
Winding Brook.</p>
<p>I do believe I am only half joking.</p>

<h2>18:22</h2>

<p>I think the field formerly known as The Ruin Field, which wasn’t
really a name, is now called Stargazey. It just struck me, on my way to
get a bit more wood for the fire, how open it feels since the lightning
struck the hawthorn down, and that word popped into my head looking at
it, just like that: Stargazey. It is roughly south-facing from the
house, and indeed is the way I most look at the stars — get a big show
of Orion there all winter, and have Mars, Jupiter, and Venus all visible
just after dark at the moment, arcing off towards the west. Well, it is
cloudy tonight, but I guess they’re there just the same. Just the same
old diff’rent from yesterday, like ev’rythink.</p>
<p>Stargazey. The place where Fae Lurk and Amulet’s shall sit. One of
our most precious and variable, and lived in, fields. I shall have to
carry Leviathan out there one of these nights.</p>
<p>Or one of these winters.</p>
